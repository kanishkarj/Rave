1
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,982
Three of a kind, let's do this.
That's it? Three guys?

2
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,481
Two guys on the roof. Every
guy gets a share. Five shares is plenty.

3
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,107
Six shares. Don't
forget the guy who planned the job.

4
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,567
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice.

5
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,859
- I know why they call him the Joker.
Why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,861
I heard he wears makeup.
Makeup?

7
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,994
Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.

8
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:19,754
All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,925
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,052
Let's go, pal,
I'm making a withdrawal here.

11
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,769
- I said, hands up!
- No!

12
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:30,387
Here comes the silent alarm.

13
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:31,893
And there it goes.

14
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,265
Heads down!

15
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,768
All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:38,614
- Down! I said, stay down there!
Don't hurt me!

17
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:41,865
Funny, it didn't dial 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,944
Is it a problem?
No, I'm done here.

19
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,710
Sit down! Down!

20
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:58,373
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,473
Obviously we don't want you
doing anything with your hands...

22
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:08,558
...other than holding on for dear life.

23
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,311
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

24
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:22,152
Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!

25
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:39,621
Yeah!

26
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,544
You have any idea
who you're stealing from?

27
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:48,422
- You and your friends are dead.
He's out, right?

28
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:52,764
What...?

29
00:04:00,613 --> 00:04:02,355
Where did you learn to count?

30
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,197
They wired this thing up
with like 5000 volts.

31
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,613
What kind of bank does that?

32
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:11,823
A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

33
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,029
Where's the alarm guy?

34
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:15,698
Boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

35
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:17,205
One less share, right?

36
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,370
Funny, he told me something similar.

37
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:22,006
He what? No! No!

38
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:35,103
That's a lot of money.

39
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:38,971
If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

40
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:44,315
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me
soon as we loaded the cash.

41
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,022
No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

42
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:50,858
Bus driver?

43
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:54,575
What bus driver?

44
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,578
School's out. Time to go.

45
00:05:00,756 --> 00:05:02,996
That guy's not getting up, is he?

46
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,417
That's a lot of money.

47
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,254
What happened to the rest of the guys?

48
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:20,394
You think you're smart, huh?

49
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:22,732
The guy that hired youse...

50
00:05:23,278 --> 00:05:25,850
...he'll just do the same to you.

51
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:29,108
Oh, criminals in this town
used to believe in things.

52
00:05:29,284 --> 00:05:30,563
Honor...

53
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:32,450
...respect.

54
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,944
Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?

55
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:36,402
What do you believe in?!

56
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,660
I believe whatever doesn't kill you
simply makes you...

57
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:44,797
...stranger.

58
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:29,673
Mr. Mayor, you were elected
in a campaign to clean up the city.

59
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:32,000
- When are you gonna start?
I already have.

60
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:33,257
Like this Batman.

61
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,002
We're hearing he's doing good,
criminals are running scared.

62
00:06:36,183 --> 00:06:39,882
- No, man. I don't like it tonight.
- What are you, superstitious?

63
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:43,145
You got more chance of winning
the Powerball than running into him.

64
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:46,682
That's not true. Our men in the
Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.

65
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,812
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says
you're closing in on the Batman.

66
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:52,109
The investigation is ongoing.

67
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:54,688
The process of cleaning up
the streets is a long one.

68
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:56,859
I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...

69
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,495
Ever intending to see your wife again,
lieutenant?

70
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:06,336
I thought you had to
go look after your mother, detective.

71
00:07:06,505 --> 00:07:08,461
Checked her back into the hospital.

72
00:07:08,924 --> 00:07:10,547
I'm sorry.

73
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:14,335
- So he hasn't shown up?
- He often doesn't.

74
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:16,427
I like reminding everybody
he's out there.

75
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:17,877
Why wouldn't he come?

76
00:07:18,224 --> 00:07:20,049
Hopefully...

77
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,101
...because he's busy.

78
00:07:38,828 --> 00:07:41,744
That's why we bring dogs.

79
00:07:41,914 --> 00:07:44,238
- My little princes.
Please.

80
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:47,998
Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.

81
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:50,921
Look what your drugs
do to my customers.

82
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,713
Buyer beware.

83
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:56,086
I told you my compound
would take you places.

84
00:07:56,262 --> 00:07:59,012
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

85
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:01,717
My business, repeat customers.

86
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:03,598
You don't like
what I have to offer...

87
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:05,511
...you can buy from someone else.

88
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:08,438
Assuming Batman left anyone
to buy from.

89
00:08:11,777 --> 00:08:15,773
My dogs are hungry.

90
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,781
Pity there's only one of you.

91
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:31,411
What...?
That's not him.

92
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:37,543
Loose the dogs!

93
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:51,814
That's more like it.

94
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:21,645
Don't let me find you out here again.

95
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,656
- We're trying to help you.
I don't need help.

96
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,152
Not my diagnosis.

97
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,907
What gives you the right? What's
the difference between you and me?

98
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,949
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

99
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:38,417
Everybody back now!

100
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,755
He can't resist showing us his face.

101
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,171
What's he hiding under that makeup?

102
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,567
Uh, can we get a minute,
people, please?

103
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,353
Him again. Who are the others?

104
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,108
Another bunch of smalltimers.

105
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,199
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

106
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,657
My detectives have been
making drug buys with them.

107
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,402
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.

108
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:18,154
- We found the bulk of their dirty cash.
- Time to move in.

109
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:22,117
We'd have to hit all banks
simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.

110
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:24,122
What about this Joker guy?

111
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,251
One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.

112
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:29,751
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

113
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,466
- Do you trust him?
- Be hard to keep him out.

114
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:36,091
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

115
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:22,597
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.

116
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:25,476
You can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse...

117
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:27,192
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

118
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:31,108
Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.

119
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:34,281
Yeah. It makes me learn
from my mistakes.

120
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:37,865
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.

121
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:40,611
My armor.

122
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:44,372
I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be... I need to be faster.

123
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:47,213
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.

124
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:49,870
- Did you get mauled by a tiger?
- It was a dog.

125
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,586
- Huh?
- It was a big dog.

126
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:56,627
There were more copycats last night,
Alfred, with guns.

127
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:58,715
Why not hire them,
take the weekend off?

128
00:12:58,892 --> 00:13:01,726
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind...

129
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:03,637
...when I said I wanted
to inspire people.

130
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:05,722
I know.

131
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,392
But things have improved.

132
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:10,063
Look at the new district attorney.

133
00:13:10,737 --> 00:13:12,728
I am, closely.

134
00:13:12,906 --> 00:13:14,814
Need to know if he can be trusted.

135
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:19,034
Are you interested in his character
or his social circle?

136
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:25,245
Who Rachel spends her time with
is her business.

137
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:29,285
I trust you don't have me followed
on my day off.

138
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:31,538
If you ever took one, I might.

139
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:35,256
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

140
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:38,546
Batman has no limits.

141
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:41,758
- Well, you do, sir.
- Well, can't afford to know them.

142
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:44,424
And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

143
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:47,307
We all know how much you like to say
"I told you so."

144
00:13:47,482 --> 00:13:50,814
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

145
00:13:50,985 --> 00:13:52,442
Probably.

146
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:00,943
Sorry I'm late, folks.

147
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:07,079
- Where were you?
- Worried you'd have to step up?

148
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:10,250
- Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
- Well, then...

149
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:12,412
...fair's fair.

150
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,628
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

151
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,874
Yeah? You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads?

152
00:14:17,052 --> 00:14:20,466
My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

153
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,804
I wouldn't leave something like that
up to chance.

154
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:27,226
I don't. I make my own luck.

155
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:32,774
All rise.
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.

156
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:35,611
I thought the DA just
played golf with the mayor.

157
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:39,478
Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.

158
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:41,199
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...

159
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:44,367
...someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called family.

160
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,487
Is that man in this courtroom today?

161
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:52,659
- Could you identify him for us, please?
- You win, counselor.

162
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:56,499
It was me.

163
00:14:58,218 --> 00:15:02,000
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...

164
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,879
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.

165
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,185
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

166
00:15:11,564 --> 00:15:13,105
Order.
- Permission to treat...

167
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:14,517
...the witness as hostile?
- Granted.

168
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:15,723
- Hostile? I'll show you hostile!

169
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,700
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber,
made in China.

170
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:26,410
If you wanna kill a
public servant, Mr. Maroni...

171
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,784
...I recommend you buy American.

172
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:32,327
Get him out of here.
- But, Your Honor, I'm not done.

173
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:39,331
We'll never be able to link the gun
to Maroni, so we can't charge him.

174
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:42,295
But they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

175
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,588
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.

176
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:47,471
Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.

177
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:50,476
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

178
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:51,842
But, you know...

179
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:55,353
...if you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.

180
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:58,440
Can't. I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here.

181
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:03,355
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

182
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,202
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

183
00:16:18,505 --> 00:16:20,626
It's a shame Sal's going to walk.

184
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,842
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

185
00:16:30,017 --> 00:16:32,341
Lightly irradiated bills.

186
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:35,098
Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?

187
00:16:35,564 --> 00:16:37,270
We liaise with various agencies...

188
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:39,183
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

189
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:42,940
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight.

190
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:45,270
Mm-hm. What about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

191
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:47,855
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...

192
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:51,236
...I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance, counselor.

193
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:54,074
I've put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...

194
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:56,620
...but the Mob
is still getting its money out.

195
00:16:56,793 --> 00:17:00,243
I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town.

196
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:03,125
You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

197
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:04,460
It's bold.

198
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,540
You gonna count me in?

199
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:10,462
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

200
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,880
I don't like that you got
your own special unit...

201
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:15,975
...and it's full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs.

202
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:18,979
If I didn't work with cops
you'd investigated while at IA...

203
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:20,391
...I'd be working alone.

204
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,058
I don't get political points
for being an idealist.

205
00:17:23,236 --> 00:17:25,642
I do the best I can with what I have.

206
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:32,989
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...

207
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:34,987
...without telling me what we're after.

208
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:38,654
I can give you the names of the banks.

209
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:40,742
Well, that's a start.

210
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:43,452
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

211
00:17:43,631 --> 00:17:45,289
Oh, you don't have
to sell me, Dent.

212
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:47,457
We all know you're Gotham's
white knight.

213
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:52,169
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.

214
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:54,044
I wouldn't know about that.

215
00:17:55,226 --> 00:17:59,008
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

216
00:17:59,188 --> 00:18:03,480
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

217
00:18:03,651 --> 00:18:05,559
Well, Mr. Lau...

218
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:08,695
...I speak for the rest of the board...

219
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:12,197
...and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

220
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,697
Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished...

221
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:23,365
...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.

222
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:26,117
You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.

223
00:18:26,298 --> 00:18:28,585
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

224
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,300
It's done.

225
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:32,211
The numbers are solid.

226
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:33,928
Do them again.

227
00:18:34,097 --> 00:18:37,180
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, would we?

228
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:41,518
Another long night?

229
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:44,640
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.

230
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:46,560
But I'm not convinced.

231
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:50,399
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.

232
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:52,978
His revenue stream
must be off the books...

233
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:54,567
...maybe even illegal.

234
00:18:54,743 --> 00:18:56,401
Okay. Cancel the deal.

235
00:18:57,746 --> 00:18:58,907
You already knew.

236
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:02,158
Just needed a closer look at their books.

237
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,371
Anything else you can trouble me for?

238
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:06,377
I need a new suit.

239
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,035
Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.

240
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:12,333
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.

241
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,092
You wanna be able to turn your head.

242
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:17,337
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.

243
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:19,348
I'll see what I can do.

244
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:26,061
Took three weeks
to get a reservation here.

245
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,353
I had to tell them
I work for the government.

246
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:29,769
- Really?
- Health inspector's...

247
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:31,187
...not afraid to pull strings.

248
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:33,567
Rachel. Fancy that.

249
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,228
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

250
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,732
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.

251
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:44,283
- Natascha. Are you the prima...?
- Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

252
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,790
- Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
- Really? So you're into ballet?

253
00:19:48,128 --> 00:19:50,285
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.

254
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:54,378
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

255
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:55,748
I certainly hope not.

256
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:59,427
- Let's put a couple tables together.
- I'm not sure that they'll let us.

257
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,633
Oh, they should. I own the place.

258
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:06,054
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?

259
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,186
Well, I was raised here.
I turned out okay.

260
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:09,933
Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

261
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,601
Is...? Heh-heh.

262
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,318
The Palisades? Sure.

263
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:15,941
You know, as our new DA,
you might wanna figure out...

264
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,939
...where your jurisdiction ends.

265
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:22,064
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

266
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:25,612
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.

267
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,031
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

268
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,166
...not a man who thinks
he's above the law.

269
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:31,498
Who appointed the Batman?

270
00:20:31,671 --> 00:20:35,501
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

271
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:37,417
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

272
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:39,336
When their enemies were at the gates...

273
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:43,211
...the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

274
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,962
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.

275
00:20:46,143 --> 00:20:47,801
Harvey, the last man
that they appointed...

276
00:20:47,978 --> 00:20:50,265
...to protect the republic
was named Caesar...

277
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:53,853
...and he never gave up his power.
- Okay, fine.

278
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:55,353
You either die a hero...

279
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:58,562
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

280
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:02,237
Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life.

281
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:05,658
How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.

282
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:08,116
Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

283
00:21:08,582 --> 00:21:11,036
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

284
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:16,450
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader? Hm?

285
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:21,882
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.

286
00:21:24,264 --> 00:21:28,390
Well, I'm sold, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

287
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,394
That's nice, but I'm not
up for reelection for three years.

288
00:21:31,563 --> 00:21:33,471
No, you don't understand.

289
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:36,434
One fundraiser with my pals...

290
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:39,189
...you'll never need another cent.

291
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:56,039
What the hell is this?

292
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,498
As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.

293
00:22:00,675 --> 00:22:04,042
A relatively small amount, 68 million.

294
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,756
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

295
00:22:07,098 --> 00:22:10,631
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

296
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,766
He's not the problem. He's a nobody.

297
00:22:12,937 --> 00:22:16,304
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

298
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:18,971
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well-placed sources...

299
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:22,933
... we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills...

300
00:22:23,113 --> 00:22:25,602
... and are planning to
seize your funds today.

301
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:29,779
And since the enthusiastic new D A has
put all my competitors out of business...

302
00:22:30,412 --> 00:22:33,910
...I'm your only option.
MARONl: So, what are you proposing?

303
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:37,746
Moving all deposits to
one secure location, not a bank.

304
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,876
- Where, then?
- No one can know but me.

305
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:43,381
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you...

306
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,340
... everyone's money would be at stake.

307
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,631
What stop them getting to you?

308
00:22:47,804 --> 00:22:50,887
I go to Hong Kong,
far from Dent's jurisdiction...

309
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:54,135
... and the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

310
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:55,934
MARONl:
How soon can you move the money?

311
00:22:56,229 --> 00:22:57,307
I already have.

312
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:02,311
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait
for your permission.

313
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:06,608
Rest assured, your money is safe.

314
00:23:13,788 --> 00:23:18,781
Oh, hee-hee, aha.
Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha.

315
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,200
And I thought my jokes were bad.

316
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:24,462
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy pull your head off.

317
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:25,911
How about a magic trick?

318
00:23:29,262 --> 00:23:31,586
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

319
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:35,004
Ta-da!

320
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:36,677
It's...

321
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:39,140
It's gone.

322
00:23:39,522 --> 00:23:41,846
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

323
00:23:42,024 --> 00:23:44,858
- You ought to know, you bought it.
Sit.

324
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:48,980
I want to hear proposition.

325
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:54,190
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

326
00:23:54,537 --> 00:24:00,206
These cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.

327
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:03,498
I mean, what happened?

328
00:24:03,671 --> 00:24:07,453
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

329
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,671
You see, a guy like me...

330
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:12,885
- A freak.
Damn right.

331
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:16,173
A guy like me... Look, listen.

332
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:21,017
I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem...

333
00:24:21,188 --> 00:24:23,891
...group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.

334
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:27,185
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

335
00:24:29,404 --> 00:24:31,062
The Batman.

336
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,481
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

337
00:24:36,662 --> 00:24:40,160
Dent, he's just the beginning.

338
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:45,493
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

339
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:47,834
...Batman has no jurisdiction.

340
00:24:48,006 --> 00:24:50,578
He'll find him and make him squeal.

341
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:53,758
I know the squealers when I see them...

342
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:55,587
...and...

343
00:24:56,348 --> 00:24:57,841
What do you propose?

344
00:24:58,016 --> 00:25:00,422
It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

345
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,722
If it's so simple, why haven't
you done it already?

346
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:07,601
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

347
00:25:08,276 --> 00:25:09,555
How much you want?

348
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:12,269
Uh, half.

349
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,240
You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

350
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,531
No, I'm not.

351
00:25:21,122 --> 00:25:24,536
If we don't deal with this now...

352
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:26,332
...soon...

353
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:31,454
...little Gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.

354
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:33,590
Enough from the clown!

355
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:36,711
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...

356
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:39,423
Shit!
...this out of proportion.

357
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:42,087
You think you can steal from us
and just walk away?

358
00:25:42,268 --> 00:25:43,809
- Yeah.
I'm putting the word out.

359
00:25:43,978 --> 00:25:46,265
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

360
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:49,474
A million alive, so I can teach him
some manners first.

361
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:53,348
All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...

362
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:57,276
...when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously?

363
00:25:57,449 --> 00:25:59,321
Here's my card.

364
00:26:03,372 --> 00:26:05,410
Mm-mm.

365
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:21,800
You're a hard man to reach.

366
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,097
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

367
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:31,231
If you'd have asked,
I could have taken his passport.

368
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:34,067
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.

369
00:26:34,236 --> 00:26:37,520
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved...

370
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:38,727
My office?

371
00:26:38,907 --> 00:26:42,571
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

372
00:26:42,744 --> 00:26:45,862
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat.

373
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:50,580
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

374
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:55,335
We need Lau back...

375
00:26:55,507 --> 00:26:59,455
...but the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

376
00:26:59,802 --> 00:27:02,505
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

377
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,877
I'll get him to sing.

378
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:06,807
We're going after the Mob's life savings.

379
00:27:06,976 --> 00:27:08,219
Things will get ugly.

380
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:10,681
I knew the risk when I took this job,
lieutenant.

381
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:12,396
How will you get him back, any...?

382
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:16,393
He does that.

383
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:20,067
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.

384
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:23,737
Well, I'm sure that you've always
wanted to go to Hong Kong.

385
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,067
What's wrong with a phone call?

386
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:29,862
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.

387
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,908
Now, for high-altitude jumps...

388
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:35,871
...you're going to need oxygen
and stabilizers.

389
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:39,663
Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...

390
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:42,414
...jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward.

391
00:27:43,053 --> 00:27:45,174
What about getting back into the plane?

392
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:49,177
- I'd recommend a good travel agent.
- Without it landing.

393
00:27:50,352 --> 00:27:53,102
Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

394
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:56,267
The CIA had a program
back in the '60s...

395
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:59,774
...for getting their people out
of hot spots called Sky Hook.

396
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:02,613
- We could look into that.
- Yeah.

397
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,439
Okay. Now...

398
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,654
Hardened Kevlar plates
over titanium-dipped...

399
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:10,950
...tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

400
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:13,957
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

401
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,619
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

402
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,789
- Yeah.
- Now, there is a tradeoff.

403
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:25,465
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

404
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:28,589
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?

405
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:30,803
How will it hold up against dogs?

406
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:33,097
We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?

407
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,801
Should do fine against cats.

408
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,102
I found one in Arizona.

409
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:42,191
A very nice man said he could have it
up and running in a week...

410
00:28:42,362 --> 00:28:43,440
...and he takes cash.

411
00:28:43,613 --> 00:28:46,447
- What about the flight crew?
- South Korean smugglers.

412
00:28:46,616 --> 00:28:48,821
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar.

413
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,743
- Did you think of an alibi?
- Oh, yes.

414
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:13,135
I believe this is your plane, sir.

415
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,853
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?

416
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:26,024
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

417
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:40,996
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

418
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,995
They brought the body.

419
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:01,885
So, dead, that's 500.

420
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:05,649
How about alive? Hm?

421
00:30:08,863 --> 00:30:12,028
You wanna know how I got these scars?

422
00:30:13,951 --> 00:30:16,950
My father was...

423
00:30:17,121 --> 00:30:18,578
...a drinker...

424
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:19,990
...and a fiend.

425
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:24,995
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

426
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:28,207
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

427
00:30:28,382 --> 00:30:29,923
He doesn't like that...

428
00:30:30,092 --> 00:30:33,542
...not one bit.

429
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,256
So, me watching...

430
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:41,008
...he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

431
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:44,269
He turns to me and he says:

432
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:48,103
"Why so serious?"

433
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,936
He comes at me with the knife.

434
00:30:50,612 --> 00:30:52,520
"Why so serious?"

435
00:30:54,783 --> 00:30:57,652
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

436
00:30:57,994 --> 00:31:01,907
"Let's put a smile on that face."

437
00:31:03,124 --> 00:31:05,329
And...

438
00:31:07,712 --> 00:31:09,253
Why so serious?

439
00:31:14,302 --> 00:31:15,795
Now...

440
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,210
...our operation is small...

441
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:21,305
...but there is a lot of potential...

442
00:31:21,476 --> 00:31:24,012
...for aggressive expansion.

443
00:31:24,187 --> 00:31:27,389
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

444
00:31:27,565 --> 00:31:31,976
Oh. There's only one spot open
right now, so we're gonna have...

445
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:34,810
...tryouts.

446
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,401
Make it fast.

447
00:31:50,838 --> 00:31:52,247
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

448
00:31:52,423 --> 00:31:55,126
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.

449
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:57,209
I understand.

450
00:32:07,021 --> 00:32:10,602
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile.

451
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:12,350
Of course.

452
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:18,811
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

453
00:32:18,991 --> 00:32:22,524
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

454
00:32:22,703 --> 00:32:25,239
...I couldn't let it threaten my company.
- Of course.

455
00:32:25,414 --> 00:32:28,579
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

456
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:32,698
...with you here now, we can continue.

457
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:36,626
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...

458
00:32:38,176 --> 00:32:40,001
We do not allow cell phones in here.

459
00:32:40,178 --> 00:32:42,881
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

460
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:47,681
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

461
00:32:48,228 --> 00:32:51,311
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

462
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,396
...whatever it is you're accused of being.

463
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:57,139
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

464
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,233
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

465
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:04,774
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.

466
00:33:04,953 --> 00:33:06,576
Just accidentally wasting it.

467
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,742
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

468
00:33:12,543 --> 00:33:13,870
Hey, sir.

469
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:34,095
There's a better view
from the peak tram.

470
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:36,098
How's the view from LSI Holdings?

471
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,941
Restricted.

472
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,101
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

473
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:42,187
- What's this?
- I had R & D work it up.

474
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:44,022
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

475
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,034
...records the response time
for mapping an environment.

476
00:33:47,536 --> 00:33:50,108
Sonar. Just like a...

477
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:52,446
Submarine, Mr. Wayne.
Like a submarine.

478
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,783
- And the other device?
- It's in place.

479
00:33:55,711 --> 00:33:56,741
Mr. Wayne?

480
00:33:57,963 --> 00:33:59,242
Good luck.

481
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:52,398
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

482
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:55,853
The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

483
00:37:56,031 --> 00:38:00,157
Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?

484
00:38:00,327 --> 00:38:02,033
- Are you threatening my client?
- No.

485
00:38:02,204 --> 00:38:06,414
I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.

486
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:09,701
As will everyone.

487
00:38:11,046 --> 00:38:14,378
No? Okay.

488
00:38:14,841 --> 00:38:17,840
Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.

489
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:19,504
Wait!

490
00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:21,712
I won't give you the money...

491
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,889
...but I will give you my clients,
all of them.

492
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:27,390
You were a glorified accountant.

493
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:31,392
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

494
00:38:31,566 --> 00:38:35,396
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.

495
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,146
One big pot.

496
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:39,858
Got it.

497
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:42,108
One minute.

498
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,613
RICO. If they pooled their money...

499
00:38:45,788 --> 00:38:47,578
...we can charge them
as one criminal conspiracy.

500
00:38:47,749 --> 00:38:48,910
Charge them with what?

501
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:51,952
In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of them with a felony...

502
00:38:52,128 --> 00:38:54,700
You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.

503
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,998
Mr. Lau.

504
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:03,006
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?

505
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,803
- Ledgers...?
- Immunity, protection...

506
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:08,424
...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
- After you testify in open court.

507
00:39:08,602 --> 00:39:10,926
I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...

508
00:39:11,272 --> 00:39:13,477
...what's gonna happen
with all that money?

509
00:39:13,649 --> 00:39:16,767
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

510
00:39:16,944 --> 00:39:21,604
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

511
00:39:21,782 --> 00:39:24,318
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

512
00:39:24,618 --> 00:39:27,286
Well, you trust them over at County?

513
00:39:27,454 --> 00:39:29,279
I don't trust them here.

514
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:32,534
Lau stays.

515
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:35,573
Well, I don 't know about
Mr. Lau's travel arrangements...

516
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:37,544
... but I'm sure glad he's back.

517
00:39:37,713 --> 00:39:40,167
Put word out. We hire the clown.

518
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:46,799
He was right.
We have to fix real problem.

519
00:39:47,306 --> 00:39:48,419
Batman.

520
00:39:52,978 --> 00:39:56,891
- I'm not aware of any participation...
- Our boy looks good on the tube.

521
00:39:57,399 --> 00:40:00,149
You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends?

522
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:03,983
Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.

523
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:12,654
Have a nice trip. See you next fall.

524
00:40:12,831 --> 00:40:14,656
Seven hundred
twelve counts of extortion.

525
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:17,239
Eight hundred and forty-nine
counts of racketeering.

526
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:19,955
Two hundred and forty-six
counts of fraud.

527
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,964
Eighty-seven counts
of conspiracy murder.

528
00:40:23,884 --> 00:40:27,002
Five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice.

529
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:28,803
How do the defendants plead?

530
00:40:35,979 --> 00:40:37,009
Order in the court.

531
00:40:37,189 --> 00:40:39,678
Five hundred and forty-nine
criminals at once.

532
00:40:39,858 --> 00:40:42,347
How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce?

533
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:46,653
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

534
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:49,858
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo...

535
00:40:50,035 --> 00:40:52,607
...you're gonna set
a new record at appeals.

536
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:55,276
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.

537
00:40:55,457 --> 00:40:57,863
But the midlevel guys, they can't.

538
00:40:58,042 --> 00:40:59,867
They can't afford to be off the streets.

539
00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:02,165
They'll cut deals that
include some jail time.

540
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:05,337
Think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets.

541
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:10,002
Mr. Mayor, you can't...
- No, get out. Both of you.

542
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:15,724
Sit down.

543
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,689
The public likes you. That's the
only reason that this might fly.

544
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,187
But that means it's on you.

545
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:28,396
They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.

546
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:32,402
Politicians, journalists, cops.

547
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:35,065
Anyone whose wallet's
about to get lighter.

548
00:41:35,246 --> 00:41:37,914
Are you up to it? You'd better be.

549
00:41:38,082 --> 00:41:40,203
Because they get anything on you...

550
00:41:40,376 --> 00:41:45,167
...and those criminals are back on the
streets, followed swiftly by you and me.

551
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:46,618
Jesus!

552
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:10,232
I think your fundraiser
will be a great success, sir.

553
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:13,073
And why do you think I wanna
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

554
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:16,324
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself...

555
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:18,533
...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:

556
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:20,495
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

557
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:24,744
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.

558
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,789
Police released video
footage found concealed on the body.

559
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:30,584
Sensitive viewers, be aware.
The image is disturbing.

560
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:32,964
Tell them your name.

561
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:34,794
Brian Douglas.

562
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:38,713
And are you the real Batman?

563
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:39,922
No.
No?

564
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:42,057
- No.
- No?

565
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:43,934
Then why do you dress up like him?

566
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:46,512
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

567
00:42:46,691 --> 00:42:50,770
Because he's a symbol that we
don 't have to be afraid of scum like you.

568
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:54,277
Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.

569
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:58,066
Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, shh.

570
00:42:58,244 --> 00:43:02,703
So you think Batman 's
made Gotham a better place? Hm?

571
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:04,456
Look at me.

572
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,912
Look at me!

573
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:14,171
You see, this is how crazy
Batman 's made Gotham.

574
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:16,630
You want order in Gotham...

575
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:21,382
... Batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in.

576
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:25,341
Oh, and every day he doesn 't,
people will die.

577
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:27,809
Starting tonight.

578
00:43:28,232 --> 00:43:30,437
I'm a man of my word.

579
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:50,543
Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld...

580
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:53,795
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

581
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:55,209
- I'll be back.
- Rachel.

582
00:43:55,384 --> 00:43:58,218
A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?

583
00:43:58,387 --> 00:44:00,793
- Thank you. Alfred, right?
- That's right, sir.

584
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:04,257
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life.

585
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:05,677
Not yet, sir.

586
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,219
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

587
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,638
Oh, you have no idea.

588
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:32,995
I'm sorry that I'm late.

589
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,542
I'm glad to see
that you all got started without me.

590
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:39,414
Now, where is Harvey? Where...?

591
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,000
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

592
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,507
Where's Rachel Dawes?

593
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,052
She is my oldest friend. Come here.

594
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,714
When Rachel first told me she
was dating Harvey Dent...

595
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:50,092
...I had one thing to say:

596
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,719
"The guy from those God-awful
campaign commercials?"

597
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:56,729
"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

598
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:58,894
But it caught Rachel's attention.

599
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:02,070
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey...

600
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,775
...and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.

601
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,743
And you know what?

602
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,283
I believe in Harvey Dent.

603
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:15,040
I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...

604
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,876
...a little safer, a little more optimistic.

605
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:24,629
Look at this face. This is the face
of Gotham's bright future.

606
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,962
To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.

607
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,890
Harvey.

608
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,859
Harvey may not know you
well enough...

609
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,984
...to understand you're
making fun of him...

610
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,147
...but I do.
- No, I meant every word.

611
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,408
You know that day
that you once told me about...

612
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,653
...when Gotham would no longer
need Batman?

613
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,739
- It's coming.
- Bruce.

614
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:59,168
- You can't ask me to wait for that.
- It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

615
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:03,798
He locked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

616
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,174
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

617
00:46:07,013 --> 00:46:09,300
You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.

618
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,592
Thanks again.

619
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,101
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

620
00:46:18,566 --> 00:46:20,937
Lieutenant, that joker card
pinned to the body?

621
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,853
Forensics found three sets of DNA.

622
00:46:23,029 --> 00:46:24,438
- Any matches?
- All three.

623
00:46:24,614 --> 00:46:28,112
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

624
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:30,275
The Joker's telling us
who he's targeting.

625
00:46:30,453 --> 00:46:33,322
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

626
00:46:33,498 --> 00:46:35,536
Protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

627
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:37,201
- City hall.
- Seal the building.

628
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,368
- No one in or out till I get there.
- Got it.

629
00:46:51,682 --> 00:46:54,053
Gordon. What are you up to?

630
00:46:54,226 --> 00:46:57,475
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor
search of the entire building.

631
00:46:57,647 --> 00:47:00,219
We believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.

632
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:01,808
These are dangerous people.

633
00:47:01,984 --> 00:47:03,726
You're not giving me
a lot of information.

634
00:47:03,903 --> 00:47:05,859
Even we don't know
where you're going.

635
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,362
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

636
00:47:13,203 --> 00:47:15,111
You can't leave me alone
with these people.

637
00:47:15,289 --> 00:47:18,324
The whole Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?

638
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,456
Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

639
00:47:20,627 --> 00:47:24,208
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...

640
00:47:24,381 --> 00:47:28,460
...take my word, the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats.

641
00:47:28,635 --> 00:47:34,173
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

642
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:36,631
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

643
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,137
Yeah, I bet.

644
00:47:38,312 --> 00:47:42,604
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...

645
00:47:42,774 --> 00:47:44,765
...about who you wanna
spend your life with.

646
00:47:44,943 --> 00:47:47,942
- That's a pretty big commitment.
- Not if the Mob has their way.

647
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,863
You get to explain to my wife...

648
00:47:56,788 --> 00:47:58,364
...why I'm late for dinner.

649
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,705
Sir, the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

650
00:48:03,294 --> 00:48:05,914
- Don't do that.
- All right.

651
00:48:06,464 --> 00:48:09,380
- Let's be serious, then.
- Okay.

652
00:48:09,717 --> 00:48:10,747
What's your answer?

653
00:48:16,933 --> 00:48:18,426
I don't have an answer.

654
00:48:20,603 --> 00:48:21,633
How'd they get my DNA?

655
00:48:21,813 --> 00:48:23,970
Somebody with access
to your office or house...

656
00:48:24,148 --> 00:48:26,768
...must have lifted a tissue
or a glass... Wait! Wait!

657
00:48:26,943 --> 00:48:29,859
- Well, I guess no answer is a no.
- Harvey.

658
00:48:30,029 --> 00:48:32,150
- It's someone else, isn't it?
- Harvey.

659
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:35,488
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f...

660
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:37,450
What are you doing?

661
00:48:48,631 --> 00:48:49,661
Oh, shit.

662
00:48:55,846 --> 00:48:57,588
Get a medic!

663
00:49:01,018 --> 00:49:02,131
They've come for him.

664
00:49:03,646 --> 00:49:04,807
We made it.

665
00:49:07,398 --> 00:49:08,428
Stay hidden.

666
00:49:10,693 --> 00:49:14,025
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

667
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:20,862
We are tonight's entertainment.

668
00:49:21,704 --> 00:49:24,028
I only have one question:

669
00:49:24,248 --> 00:49:27,781
Where is Harvey Dent?

670
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:39,335
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

671
00:49:39,513 --> 00:49:40,792
Hands up, pretty boy.

672
00:49:47,938 --> 00:49:50,724
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him.

673
00:49:50,899 --> 00:49:53,733
Just something little, huh? No.

674
00:49:56,029 --> 00:49:58,779
What's going on out there? Wayne!

675
00:50:00,242 --> 00:50:01,616
Oh, thank God, you've
got a panic room.

676
00:50:01,785 --> 00:50:02,946
Hey, wait...

677
00:50:03,537 --> 00:50:05,327
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

678
00:50:05,622 --> 00:50:07,613
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

679
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:11,289
We're not intimidated by thugs.

680
00:50:12,254 --> 00:50:13,960
You know...

681
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:18,589
...you remind me of my father.

682
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:20,877
I hated my father.

683
00:50:21,054 --> 00:50:23,092
Okay, stop.

684
00:50:26,935 --> 00:50:29,769
Well, hello, beautiful.

685
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,770
You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?

686
00:50:36,152 --> 00:50:38,641
And you are beautiful.

687
00:50:45,578 --> 00:50:49,444
You look nervous. Is it the scars?

688
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:52,580
You wanna know how I got them?

689
00:50:53,795 --> 00:50:56,331
Come here. Hey.

690
00:50:56,714 --> 00:50:58,420
Look at me.

691
00:50:58,883 --> 00:51:03,627
So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...

692
00:51:03,888 --> 00:51:08,098
...who tells me I worry too much...

693
00:51:08,267 --> 00:51:11,183
...who tells me I ought to smile more...

694
00:51:11,354 --> 00:51:16,857
...who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

695
00:51:17,276 --> 00:51:19,682
One day they carve her face.

696
00:51:20,196 --> 00:51:24,441
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

697
00:51:24,825 --> 00:51:28,323
I just wanna see her smile again. Hm?

698
00:51:28,662 --> 00:51:31,578
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

699
00:51:32,124 --> 00:51:33,665
So...

700
00:51:34,251 --> 00:51:37,915
...I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

701
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,754
...to myself.

702
00:51:40,049 --> 00:51:45,124
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

703
00:51:45,304 --> 00:51:46,845
She leaves.

704
00:51:47,556 --> 00:51:49,962
Now I see the funny side.

705
00:51:50,851 --> 00:51:52,427
Now I'm always smiling.

706
00:51:55,856 --> 00:51:59,188
You got a little fight in you. I like that.

707
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,686
Then you're gonna love me.

708
00:52:28,847 --> 00:52:30,044
Drop the gun.

709
00:52:30,223 --> 00:52:32,843
Oh, sure. You just take off
your little mask...

710
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:35,222
...and show us all who
you really are. Hm?

711
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:42,055
Let her go.

712
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,269
Very poor choice of words.

713
00:53:07,093 --> 00:53:08,965
Are you all right?

714
00:53:11,222 --> 00:53:13,593
Let's not do that again.

715
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:16,380
- Is Harvey okay?
- He's safe.

716
00:53:17,937 --> 00:53:19,264
Thank you.

717
00:53:19,605 --> 00:53:20,635
Jim, it's over.

718
00:53:20,814 --> 00:53:23,386
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

719
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,060
The prosecution's over.

720
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:26,893
Nobody's standing up
in front of a judge...

721
00:53:27,071 --> 00:53:30,070
...while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away.

722
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,030
- What about Dent?
- He's got any sense...

723
00:53:32,201 --> 00:53:33,279
...Dent's halfway to Mex...

724
00:53:33,452 --> 00:53:35,028
So where do you keep your trash?

725
00:53:36,371 --> 00:53:40,319
You're due in court. I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.

726
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,535
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

727
00:53:43,712 --> 00:53:47,044
You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.

728
00:53:47,215 --> 00:53:49,669
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

729
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:52,587
Targeting me won't get their money.

730
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:54,588
I knew the Mob wouldn't go
down easily...

731
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:56,839
...but this is different.
They crossed a line.

732
00:53:57,017 --> 00:53:58,260
You crossed the line first.

733
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:01,849
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

734
00:54:02,022 --> 00:54:07,015
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

735
00:54:07,527 --> 00:54:10,063
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

736
00:54:10,238 --> 00:54:12,443
We just need to figure out
what he's after.

737
00:54:12,615 --> 00:54:14,024
With respect, Master Wayne...

738
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,152
...perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

739
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:20,657
A long time ago, I was in Burma...

740
00:54:20,832 --> 00:54:24,246
...and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

741
00:54:24,419 --> 00:54:26,991
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

742
00:54:27,171 --> 00:54:30,005
...by bribing them with
precious stones...

743
00:54:30,174 --> 00:54:34,751
...but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

744
00:54:34,929 --> 00:54:38,213
So we went looking for the stones.

745
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:43,722
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

746
00:54:44,355 --> 00:54:48,351
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

747
00:54:48,526 --> 00:54:51,561
...the size of a tangerine.

748
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:55,188
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

749
00:54:55,866 --> 00:54:58,569
- So why steal them?
- Because he thought it was good sport.

750
00:54:58,744 --> 00:55:03,700
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

751
00:55:03,874 --> 00:55:08,119
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

752
00:55:08,546 --> 00:55:12,376
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

753
00:55:32,819 --> 00:55:33,980
Your name, sir?

754
00:55:34,154 --> 00:55:37,319
Eighth and Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.

755
00:55:50,212 --> 00:55:51,669
Check the names.

756
00:55:58,261 --> 00:55:59,967
"Richard Dent."

757
00:56:02,182 --> 00:56:03,260
"Patrick Harvey."

758
00:56:03,558 --> 00:56:04,588
Harvey Dent.

759
00:56:04,768 --> 00:56:07,767
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

760
00:56:07,979 --> 00:56:10,184
It's because of you
these guys are dead...

761
00:56:10,356 --> 00:56:11,897
Detective!

762
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:16,148
Give us a minute, guys.

763
00:56:17,363 --> 00:56:18,939
That's brick underneath.

764
00:56:19,282 --> 00:56:20,940
Gonna take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?

765
00:56:21,117 --> 00:56:22,740
No.

766
00:56:24,203 --> 00:56:26,111
Fingerprints.

767
00:56:34,672 --> 00:56:36,580
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

768
00:56:38,384 --> 00:56:43,091
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

769
00:57:00,406 --> 00:57:02,693
I'm not sure
you made it loud enough, sir.

770
00:57:15,796 --> 00:57:17,917
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

771
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:21,872
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again.

772
00:57:22,552 --> 00:57:24,839
Well, I found some irregularities.

773
00:57:25,263 --> 00:57:27,337
Their CEO is in police custody.

774
00:57:27,516 --> 00:57:30,432
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

775
00:57:30,644 --> 00:57:33,727
Applied Sciences. Whole division
of Wayne Enterprises...

776
00:57:33,897 --> 00:57:35,555
...just disappeared overnight.

777
00:57:35,732 --> 00:57:39,977
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.

778
00:57:41,112 --> 00:57:42,984
Don't tell me you didn't
recognize your baby...

779
00:57:43,156 --> 00:57:46,773
...pancaking cop cars
on the evening news.

780
00:57:47,077 --> 00:57:50,279
Now you got the entire R & D
Department burning through cash...

781
00:57:50,455 --> 00:57:53,787
...claiming it's related to
cell phones for the Army?

782
00:57:53,958 --> 00:57:57,041
What are you building for him now,
a rocket ship?

783
00:57:58,922 --> 00:58:00,664
I want...

784
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:04,753
...$ 10 million a year
for the rest of my life.

785
00:58:07,263 --> 00:58:09,384
Let me get this straight.

786
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,054
You think that your client...

787
00:58:13,227 --> 00:58:16,310
One of the wealthiest,
most powerful men in the world...

788
00:58:16,481 --> 00:58:18,057
...is secretly a vigilante...

789
00:58:18,232 --> 00:58:22,892
...who spends his nights beating
criminals to a pulp with his bare hands...

790
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:26,235
...and your plan
is to blackmail this person?

791
00:58:33,705 --> 00:58:34,984
Good luck.

792
00:58:37,876 --> 00:58:39,285
When...

793
00:58:40,712 --> 00:58:42,169
Keep that.

794
00:58:48,845 --> 00:58:51,299
This is your original scan.

795
00:58:52,724 --> 00:58:55,011
Here it is reengineered.

796
00:59:03,234 --> 00:59:06,767
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.

797
00:59:08,781 --> 00:59:09,942
I'll get you a copy.

798
00:59:10,157 --> 00:59:13,939
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R & D?

799
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,609
Yeah. Government
telecommunications project.

800
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:18,827
Wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.

801
00:59:19,083 --> 00:59:22,082
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.

802
00:59:23,212 --> 00:59:24,918
Fair enough.

803
00:59:27,841 --> 00:59:29,298
With no word
from the Batman...

804
00:59:29,468 --> 00:59:30,961
...even as they mourn
Commissioner Loeb...

805
00:59:31,136 --> 00:59:34,503
...these cops have to wonder if
the Joker will make good on his threat...

806
00:59:34,682 --> 00:59:37,884
...in the obituary column of
The Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

807
00:59:39,686 --> 00:59:43,350
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

808
00:59:43,524 --> 00:59:45,645
Cross-reference the addresses.

809
00:59:45,817 --> 00:59:49,813
Look for Parkside,
overlooking the parade.

810
00:59:51,031 --> 00:59:52,144
I got one.

811
00:59:52,324 --> 00:59:56,320
Melvin White,
1502 Randolph Apartments.

812
00:59:56,703 --> 01:00:00,782
Aggravated assault,
moved to Arkham twice.

813
01:00:39,871 --> 01:00:41,447
What do you got on the roof?

814
01:00:41,622 --> 01:00:45,155
We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.

815
01:00:53,718 --> 01:00:57,761
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...

816
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:00,217
...and to the protection
of his community.

817
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:02,181
I remember when I first took office...

818
01:01:02,351 --> 01:01:04,887
...and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.

819
01:01:05,062 --> 01:01:10,303
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

820
01:01:14,071 --> 01:01:17,236
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

821
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:21,907
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

822
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,328
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters...

823
01:01:29,711 --> 01:01:31,369
- Who's that?
- What happened?

824
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,294
They took our guns.

825
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:36,256
And our uniforms.

826
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:45,599
And as we recognize
the sacrifice of this man...

827
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:49,717
...we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

828
01:01:49,898 --> 01:01:52,387
Stand by. Honor guard.

829
01:01:52,567 --> 01:01:56,184
Attention. Port arms.

830
01:01:57,405 --> 01:02:01,781
Ready! Aim! Fire!

831
01:02:02,577 --> 01:02:04,118
Ready! Aim!

832
01:02:07,749 --> 01:02:10,120
Ready! Aim!

833
01:02:18,551 --> 01:02:19,960
Stay down! Don't move!

834
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:23,462
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

835
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:34,930
- I'll see you later.
- Why are you going back?

836
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,610
Get out of here.

837
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:54,410
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

838
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:26,777
No.

839
01:03:27,202 --> 01:03:28,529
I'm sorry, Barbara.

840
01:03:29,454 --> 01:03:32,703
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.

841
01:03:32,874 --> 01:03:35,114
If there's anything
we can do, anything you need...

842
01:03:35,293 --> 01:03:37,035
...we're here for you.

843
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:40,538
Shh.

844
01:03:40,715 --> 01:03:41,958
Are you out there?

845
01:03:43,301 --> 01:03:47,796
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

846
01:03:47,973 --> 01:03:50,344
You brought this on us!

847
01:03:51,393 --> 01:03:55,970
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.

848
01:03:56,398 --> 01:03:59,397
God help whoever
he does wanna talk to.

849
01:04:01,069 --> 01:04:03,985
Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

850
01:04:04,155 --> 01:04:06,989
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?

851
01:04:07,158 --> 01:04:08,188
What?

852
01:04:37,605 --> 01:04:39,228
- Yeah?
Second.

853
01:04:39,398 --> 01:04:40,428
Okay.

854
01:04:40,608 --> 01:04:42,765
- Harvey, where are you?
Where are you?

855
01:04:42,943 --> 01:04:45,064
I'm where you should be,
at Major Crimes.

856
01:04:45,237 --> 01:04:46,778
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

857
01:04:46,947 --> 01:04:50,528
- Can I get the fingerprint analysis?
- Rachel, listen. You're not safe there.

858
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:52,491
- This is Gordon's unit.
- Gordon 's gone.

859
01:04:52,661 --> 01:04:56,242
He vouched for these men.
- And he's gone.

860
01:05:00,878 --> 01:05:02,952
The Joker's named you next.

861
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:06,129
God, is there someone, is there anyone
in this town we can trust?

862
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,006
Bruce.

863
01:05:08,302 --> 01:05:09,463
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

864
01:05:09,636 --> 01:05:11,212
No. Rachel, I know
you're his friend, but...

865
01:05:11,388 --> 01:05:13,213
Harvey, trust me.

866
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:16,140
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

867
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:17,637
Then you go straight there.

868
01:05:17,811 --> 01:05:19,932
Don 't tell anybody
and I'll find you there.

869
01:05:20,105 --> 01:05:21,811
I love you.

870
01:05:35,829 --> 01:05:37,072
I want the Joker.

871
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:39,948
From one professional to another...

872
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:42,661
...you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

873
01:05:42,836 --> 01:05:45,408
From this height,
the fall wouldn't kill me.

874
01:05:45,588 --> 01:05:47,164
- I'm counting on it.
- Huh!

875
01:05:54,556 --> 01:05:57,674
- Where is he?
- I don't know where he is. He found us.

876
01:05:57,850 --> 01:05:59,129
He must have friends.

877
01:05:59,477 --> 01:06:01,764
Friends? Have you met this guy?

878
01:06:01,938 --> 01:06:03,514
Someone knows where he is.

879
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:06,179
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

880
01:06:06,359 --> 01:06:07,686
They're wise to your act.

881
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:11,856
You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.

882
01:06:12,031 --> 01:06:16,905
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

883
01:06:17,078 --> 01:06:18,868
But you already know what that is.

884
01:06:19,038 --> 01:06:21,824
Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.

885
01:06:23,459 --> 01:06:27,538
Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind.

886
01:06:29,215 --> 01:06:31,206
You wanna play games?

887
01:06:37,515 --> 01:06:38,545
How's that feel?

888
01:06:38,724 --> 01:06:41,344
- You wouldn't.
- I wouldn't!

889
01:06:42,853 --> 01:06:44,476
- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.

890
01:06:44,647 --> 01:06:46,685
- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.

891
01:06:48,067 --> 01:06:51,269
No. No, I wouldn't.

892
01:06:52,488 --> 01:06:55,024
That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.

893
01:06:56,033 --> 01:06:59,032
Heads, you get to keep your head.

894
01:06:59,453 --> 01:07:01,076
Tails...

895
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:03,069
...not so lucky.

896
01:07:03,457 --> 01:07:06,990
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

897
01:07:16,386 --> 01:07:20,085
- Let's go again.
- I don't know anything! God, don't!

898
01:07:20,265 --> 01:07:22,636
You're not playing the odds, friend.

899
01:07:23,768 --> 01:07:25,759
Let's do it again.

900
01:07:28,607 --> 01:07:30,432
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

901
01:07:31,192 --> 01:07:34,773
- Not exactly.
- His name's Schiff, Thomas.

902
01:07:34,946 --> 01:07:37,945
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

903
01:07:38,116 --> 01:07:42,741
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

904
01:07:46,082 --> 01:07:48,868
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

905
01:07:49,043 --> 01:07:51,829
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

906
01:07:52,005 --> 01:07:53,830
Your stand against organized crime...

907
01:07:54,007 --> 01:07:57,209
...is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.

908
01:07:57,385 --> 01:08:01,002
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

909
01:08:01,179 --> 01:08:03,466
The criminals you arrested
would be released...

910
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,723
...and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.

911
01:08:07,352 --> 01:08:09,592
You're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.

912
01:08:09,771 --> 01:08:12,142
- Why?
- No one else will die because of me.

913
01:08:12,315 --> 01:08:14,639
Gotham's in your hands now.

914
01:08:14,818 --> 01:08:16,524
You can't.

915
01:08:16,694 --> 01:08:18,068
You can't give in.

916
01:08:18,363 --> 01:08:20,899
You can't give in!

917
01:08:36,255 --> 01:08:37,498
Harvey called.

918
01:08:37,673 --> 01:08:40,708
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.

919
01:08:40,885 --> 01:08:41,998
I have no choice.

920
01:08:42,178 --> 01:08:45,261
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

921
01:08:45,431 --> 01:08:48,881
Maybe not. But I have enough blood
on my hands.

922
01:08:49,352 --> 01:08:54,178
And I've seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him.

923
01:08:54,732 --> 01:08:58,182
You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished...

924
01:08:58,361 --> 01:09:00,435
...that we'd be together.

925
01:09:01,155 --> 01:09:04,320
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.

926
01:09:05,868 --> 01:09:07,195
Did you mean it?

927
01:09:08,704 --> 01:09:10,529
Yes.

928
01:09:27,806 --> 01:09:29,596
Bruce.

929
01:09:30,559 --> 01:09:34,472
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

930
01:09:45,115 --> 01:09:48,067
Logs as well?
Everything.

931
01:09:48,243 --> 01:09:51,610
Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel.

932
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,244
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

933
01:10:00,422 --> 01:10:04,169
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

934
01:10:04,342 --> 01:10:08,041
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

935
01:10:08,221 --> 01:10:13,759
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

936
01:10:13,935 --> 01:10:15,262
The right choice.

937
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:18,805
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

938
01:10:18,982 --> 01:10:20,225
He can't endure this.

939
01:10:20,525 --> 01:10:23,394
Today you get to say "I told you so."

940
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:27,151
Today, I don't want to.

941
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:34,452
But I did bloody tell you.

942
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,499
I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well...

943
01:10:41,295 --> 01:10:42,538
...as your accomplice.

944
01:10:42,713 --> 01:10:47,457
Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

945
01:10:51,722 --> 01:10:55,255
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called
this press conference for two reasons.

946
01:10:55,434 --> 01:10:57,472
Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

947
01:10:57,645 --> 01:11:01,309
...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

948
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:05,774
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

949
01:11:05,944 --> 01:11:07,650
But let's consider the situation.

950
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,650
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

951
01:11:10,824 --> 01:11:12,281
Do we really think he's gonna...?

952
01:11:12,451 --> 01:11:15,818
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

953
01:11:15,996 --> 01:11:18,367
The Batman is an outlaw.

954
01:11:19,249 --> 01:11:21,157
That's not why we demand
he turn himself in...

955
01:11:21,335 --> 01:11:22,993
...we're doing it because we're scared.

956
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:25,956
We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now.

957
01:11:26,131 --> 01:11:29,083
Things are worse than ever!
Amen.

958
01:11:30,427 --> 01:11:32,335
Yes, they are.

959
01:11:34,848 --> 01:11:37,847
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

960
01:11:40,312 --> 01:11:42,386
And I promise you...

961
01:11:43,189 --> 01:11:44,598
...the dawn is coming.

962
01:11:44,774 --> 01:11:49,315
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

963
01:11:49,487 --> 01:11:51,229
...not to this madman.

964
01:11:51,406 --> 01:11:53,730
- No more dead cops!
Yeah!

965
01:11:57,036 --> 01:11:58,612
He should turn himself in!

966
01:11:58,788 --> 01:12:01,491
Give us the Batman! Come on!
Where is he?

967
01:12:04,377 --> 01:12:06,534
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.

968
01:12:07,005 --> 01:12:08,961
What?
Is he here?

969
01:12:09,674 --> 01:12:10,704
I am the Batman.

970
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:14,049
What?
Come on.

971
01:12:22,436 --> 01:12:24,344
Alfred.

972
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:27,480
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

973
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:30,649
- He went down to the press conference.
- I know. He just stood by.

974
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:32,894
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...

975
01:12:33,072 --> 01:12:36,071
...believe that Batman stands for
something more important...

976
01:12:36,242 --> 01:12:38,566
...than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...

977
01:12:38,744 --> 01:12:40,735
...even if everyone hates him for it.

978
01:12:40,913 --> 01:12:43,034
That's the sacrifice he's making.

979
01:12:43,207 --> 01:12:46,824
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

980
01:12:47,378 --> 01:12:49,001
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

981
01:12:49,171 --> 01:12:52,254
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

982
01:12:54,927 --> 01:12:56,550
You know him better than anyone.

983
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:58,000
I do.

984
01:13:01,391 --> 01:13:04,426
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

985
01:13:05,896 --> 01:13:07,093
How will I know?

986
01:13:07,272 --> 01:13:08,765
It's not sealed.

987
01:13:10,192 --> 01:13:11,733
Goodbye, Alfred.

988
01:13:15,906 --> 01:13:17,648
Bye, Rachel.

989
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,365
I didn't have time to talk this through.

990
01:13:27,542 --> 01:13:28,785
What are you doing?

991
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,034
They're transferring me
to Central Holding.

992
01:13:31,338 --> 01:13:35,002
This is the Joker's chance, and when he
attacks, the Batman will take him down.

993
01:13:35,175 --> 01:13:36,716
Listen. This is too dangerous.

994
01:13:36,885 --> 01:13:40,584
We get this guy to County, he's their
problem. The streets will be cleared...

995
01:13:40,764 --> 01:13:44,463
...so let's go.
The convoys stop for no reason.

996
01:13:44,642 --> 01:13:46,099
I hope you got some moves, pal.

997
01:13:46,269 --> 01:13:49,185
He's using you as bait. He doesn't
know if he can get the Joker.

998
01:13:49,355 --> 01:13:50,433
He's failed so far.

999
01:13:50,773 --> 01:13:52,314
How do you know
what he's thinking?

1000
01:13:52,483 --> 01:13:54,807
I just do. Anyway,
this isn't just about you.

1001
01:13:54,986 --> 01:13:56,811
What about the people
depending on you...

1002
01:13:56,988 --> 01:13:59,987
...to clean the city up
and do it honorably and...?

1003
01:14:05,663 --> 01:14:08,283
Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.

1004
01:14:08,666 --> 01:14:10,538
Heads, I go through with it.

1005
01:14:10,751 --> 01:14:12,659
This is your life. You can't leave...

1006
01:14:12,837 --> 01:14:15,208
...something like that to chance.
- I'm not.

1007
01:14:19,552 --> 01:14:21,958
You make your own luck.

1008
01:14:43,784 --> 01:14:45,775
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.

1009
01:14:53,418 --> 01:14:55,742
What the hell is that?

1010
01:14:55,921 --> 01:14:58,126
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

1011
01:14:58,298 --> 01:15:01,500
Damn it! All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.

1012
01:15:01,927 --> 01:15:03,040
Exit down!

1013
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:05,544
Lower Fifth? We'll be
like turkeys on Thanksgiving.

1014
01:15:38,254 --> 01:15:40,578
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.

1015
01:15:42,759 --> 01:15:45,130
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

1016
01:15:45,303 --> 01:15:46,844
We got trouble, guys.

1017
01:15:49,766 --> 01:15:50,844
Lock and load!

1018
01:16:02,069 --> 01:16:03,443
The hell was that?

1019
01:16:25,301 --> 01:16:27,969
- These are built for that, right?
- He'll need something...

1020
01:16:28,137 --> 01:16:29,927
...a lot bigger to get through this.

1021
01:16:30,973 --> 01:16:32,430
What is that?

1022
01:16:33,767 --> 01:16:35,094
What is that, a bazooka?

1023
01:16:43,735 --> 01:16:45,441
I didn't sign up for this!

1024
01:17:01,795 --> 01:17:03,122
Look out.

1025
01:17:03,922 --> 01:17:05,083
Look out!

1026
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:14,420
Hmm.

1027
01:17:27,362 --> 01:17:28,475
Come on, let's go!

1028
01:18:15,206 --> 01:18:17,412
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

1029
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:20,418
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

1030
01:18:25,341 --> 01:18:28,923
Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

1031
01:18:36,393 --> 01:18:38,515
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!

1032
01:18:44,026 --> 01:18:45,899
I like this job. I like it.

1033
01:18:48,155 --> 01:18:50,776
Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

1034
01:19:04,754 --> 01:19:06,248
Goodbye.

1035
01:19:15,348 --> 01:19:18,551
We're on point, ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

1036
01:19:24,941 --> 01:19:27,396
That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.

1037
01:19:40,957 --> 01:19:42,664
Okay, rack them up.

1038
01:19:42,834 --> 01:19:45,206
Rack them up, rack them up,
rack them up.

1039
01:20:10,945 --> 01:20:12,107
That's not good.

1040
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,814
Okay, that's not good!

1041
01:20:59,951 --> 01:21:02,027
Now, there's a Batman.

1042
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:07,531
Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.

1043
01:21:10,462 --> 01:21:11,576
Come on.

1044
01:21:20,722 --> 01:21:21,966
He missed!

1045
01:21:35,903 --> 01:21:38,310
You can't stop here.
We're like sitting ducks!

1046
01:21:55,339 --> 01:21:56,418
Come on, come on.

1047
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:02,920
Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on!

1048
01:22:05,474 --> 01:22:06,932
Come on.

1049
01:22:07,601 --> 01:22:10,934
Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.

1050
01:22:11,105 --> 01:22:12,729
Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!

1051
01:22:14,858 --> 01:22:15,889
Hit me!

1052
01:22:40,884 --> 01:22:44,134
Come on, come on. Aah!

1053
01:22:44,304 --> 01:22:46,545
Could you please just give me a minute?

1054
01:22:48,642 --> 01:22:50,468
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1055
01:22:53,772 --> 01:22:57,686
Gor... You do like to play things
pretty close to the chest.

1056
01:22:58,151 --> 01:22:59,858
We got him, Harvey.

1057
01:23:00,028 --> 01:23:03,479
Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1058
01:23:03,656 --> 01:23:06,941
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1059
01:23:07,118 --> 01:23:08,446
But you and your office...

1060
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:10,279
...have been working
with the Batman all along.

1061
01:23:10,455 --> 01:23:12,246
No, but I trusted him
to do the right thing.

1062
01:23:12,415 --> 01:23:14,491
Which was?
- Saving my ass.

1063
01:23:14,667 --> 01:23:17,584
All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.

1064
01:23:17,754 --> 01:23:19,663
Thank you, detective.

1065
01:23:19,881 --> 01:23:22,003
I've got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.

1066
01:23:22,175 --> 01:23:24,547
- I figured, counselor.
Mr. Dent, sir...

1067
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:28,847
...how about one for the front page, sir?
Mr. Dent.

1068
01:23:40,192 --> 01:23:43,358
Stand away! All of you!

1069
01:23:43,529 --> 01:23:47,028
I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer
to use, you understand?

1070
01:23:49,285 --> 01:23:51,158
Back from the dead.

1071
01:23:51,829 --> 01:23:53,371
I, uh...

1072
01:23:53,539 --> 01:23:55,448
...couldn't risk my family's safety.

1073
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:58,576
What do we got?

1074
01:24:00,254 --> 01:24:04,203
Nothing. No matches on prints,
DNA, dental.

1075
01:24:04,383 --> 01:24:07,134
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1076
01:24:07,344 --> 01:24:09,466
Nothing in his pockets
but knives and lint.

1077
01:24:09,638 --> 01:24:11,547
No name.

1078
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:13,847
- No other alias.
Go home, Gordon.

1079
01:24:14,017 --> 01:24:17,101
The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.

1080
01:24:17,271 --> 01:24:19,097
You're gonna need it.

1081
01:24:19,356 --> 01:24:21,929
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1082
01:24:22,609 --> 01:24:25,775
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

1083
01:24:41,628 --> 01:24:43,750
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.

1084
01:24:50,261 --> 01:24:51,671
Look at these ugly bastards.

1085
01:24:51,846 --> 01:24:53,719
- I don't feel good.
You're a cop killer.

1086
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:56,215
You're lucky to be feeling anything
below the neck.

1087
01:24:56,392 --> 01:24:57,969
- Please!
- Step away from the bars!

1088
01:24:58,144 --> 01:25:00,302
My insides hurt.

1089
01:25:14,494 --> 01:25:16,285
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

1090
01:25:18,456 --> 01:25:20,744
Actually, this time...

1091
01:25:20,917 --> 01:25:23,075
...I saved him.

1092
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:36,054
Has he said anything yet?

1093
01:25:43,647 --> 01:25:47,858
Evening, commissioner.

1094
01:25:55,492 --> 01:25:57,698
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1095
01:25:57,870 --> 01:25:59,992
- Of course not.
- What have you done with him?

1096
01:26:00,914 --> 01:26:02,657
Me?

1097
01:26:04,293 --> 01:26:06,415
I was right here.

1098
01:26:07,838 --> 01:26:09,664
Who did you leave him with?

1099
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,675
Hm? Your people?

1100
01:26:13,802 --> 01:26:17,135
Assuming, of course,
that they are still your people...

1101
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:20,009
...and not Maroni's.

1102
01:26:22,227 --> 01:26:24,599
Does it depress you, commissioner...

1103
01:26:25,021 --> 01:26:29,979
...to know just how alone you really are?

1104
01:26:31,987 --> 01:26:36,862
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1105
01:26:37,033 --> 01:26:39,702
- Where is he?
- What's the time?

1106
01:26:40,203 --> 01:26:41,697
What difference does that make?

1107
01:26:41,955 --> 01:26:47,411
Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or several.

1108
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,753
- lf we're gonna play games...
- Mm-hm?

1109
01:26:59,931 --> 01:27:01,888
...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1110
01:27:02,058 --> 01:27:06,138
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1111
01:27:06,812 --> 01:27:07,843
Not exactly.

1112
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:22,410
Never start with the head. The victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next...

1113
01:27:25,581 --> 01:27:26,695
See?

1114
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:29,199
You wanted me. Here I am.

1115
01:27:30,252 --> 01:27:32,374
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1116
01:27:32,922 --> 01:27:35,495
And you didn't disappoint.

1117
01:27:35,674 --> 01:27:38,509
You let five people die.

1118
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:43,135
Then you let Dent take your place.

1119
01:27:43,307 --> 01:27:45,928
- Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
- Where's Dent?

1120
01:27:46,101 --> 01:27:50,893
Those Mob fools want you gone so they
can get back to the way things were.

1121
01:27:51,398 --> 01:27:56,143
But I know the truth. There's no
going back. You've changed things.

1122
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,727
- Forever.
- Then why do you wanna kill me?

1123
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:03,110
I don't wanna kill you.

1124
01:28:03,618 --> 01:28:08,161
What would I do without you? Go back
to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.

1125
01:28:08,331 --> 01:28:10,703
No. No, you...

1126
01:28:10,876 --> 01:28:13,283
You complete me.

1127
01:28:13,461 --> 01:28:17,790
- You're garbage who kills for money.
- Don't talk like one of them. You're not.

1128
01:28:17,966 --> 01:28:20,373
Even if you'd like to be.

1129
01:28:21,636 --> 01:28:23,462
To them, you're just a freak...

1130
01:28:24,389 --> 01:28:25,717
...like me.

1131
01:28:25,890 --> 01:28:28,178
They need you right now...

1132
01:28:28,768 --> 01:28:30,807
...but when they don't...

1133
01:28:31,354 --> 01:28:34,390
...they'll cast you out like a leper.

1134
01:28:34,566 --> 01:28:38,480
You see, their morals, their code...

1135
01:28:38,736 --> 01:28:40,894
...it's a bad joke.

1136
01:28:41,155 --> 01:28:44,488
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1137
01:28:45,159 --> 01:28:49,156
They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1138
01:28:49,330 --> 01:28:52,496
When the chips are down, these...

1139
01:28:52,667 --> 01:28:54,908
These civilized people...

1140
01:28:55,086 --> 01:28:57,162
...they'll eat each other.

1141
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:00,252
See, I'm not a monster.

1142
01:29:01,634 --> 01:29:02,914
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1143
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:06,258
Where's Dent?

1144
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:09,347
You have all these rules,
and you think they'll save you.

1145
01:29:12,436 --> 01:29:14,843
- He's in control.
- I have one rule.

1146
01:29:15,022 --> 01:29:18,106
Oh. Then that's the rule you'll have
to break to know the truth.

1147
01:29:18,275 --> 01:29:19,437
Which is?

1148
01:29:19,610 --> 01:29:22,017
The only sensible way to live
is without rules.

1149
01:29:22,196 --> 01:29:24,865
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.

1150
01:29:25,032 --> 01:29:26,063
I'm considering it.

1151
01:29:26,241 --> 01:29:28,862
There's only minutes left,
so you'll have to play my game...

1152
01:29:29,036 --> 01:29:31,609
...if you wanna save one of them.

1153
01:29:32,122 --> 01:29:33,153
"Them"?

1154
01:29:33,332 --> 01:29:37,376
You know, for a while there,
I thought you really were Dent.

1155
01:29:37,544 --> 01:29:40,165
The way you threw yourself after her.

1156
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:47,549
Look at you go.

1157
01:29:53,185 --> 01:29:56,767
Does Harvey know
about you and his little bunny?

1158
01:29:57,689 --> 01:29:59,064
Where are they?!

1159
01:29:59,232 --> 01:30:01,224
Killing is making a choice.

1160
01:30:01,401 --> 01:30:04,485
- Where are they?!
- Choose between one life or the other.

1161
01:30:05,238 --> 01:30:09,484
Your friend the district attorney,
or his blushing bride-to-be.

1162
01:30:14,664 --> 01:30:18,744
You have nothing,
nothing to threaten me with.

1163
01:30:19,169 --> 01:30:22,668
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1164
01:30:22,881 --> 01:30:26,296
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you
where they are, both of them.

1165
01:30:26,467 --> 01:30:29,503
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1166
01:30:30,263 --> 01:30:33,098
He's at 25052nd Street...

1167
01:30:33,266 --> 01:30:36,599
...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.

1168
01:30:38,688 --> 01:30:40,431
- Which one you going after?
- Rachel.

1169
01:30:41,858 --> 01:30:43,268
We're getting Dent!

1170
01:30:45,528 --> 01:30:48,363
25052nd Street!

1171
01:30:51,284 --> 01:30:53,110
Hello?

1172
01:30:54,078 --> 01:30:56,450
Can anybody hear me?

1173
01:30:58,874 --> 01:31:01,495
Hello!

1174
01:31:05,506 --> 01:31:07,747
- Rachel?
- Harvey.

1175
01:31:07,925 --> 01:31:10,131
Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?

1176
01:31:10,302 --> 01:31:11,879
I'm all right. I'm in a...

1177
01:31:12,054 --> 01:31:15,636
I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.

1178
01:31:16,684 --> 01:31:17,882
I am too.

1179
01:31:18,435 --> 01:31:20,142
Harvey.

1180
01:31:27,402 --> 01:31:29,857
I want my phone call.

1181
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:32,817
I want it. I want it.
I want my phone call.

1182
01:31:33,492 --> 01:31:35,318
That's nice.

1183
01:31:36,828 --> 01:31:41,655
How many of your friends have I killed?

1184
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:46,499
I'm a 20-year man...

1185
01:31:46,671 --> 01:31:50,122
...and I know the difference between
punks who need a lesson in manners...

1186
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:53,170
...and the freaks like you
who would just enjoy it.

1187
01:31:54,054 --> 01:31:56,509
And you killed six of my friends.

1188
01:31:56,681 --> 01:31:57,712
Six?

1189
01:31:57,891 --> 01:32:00,346
Please. My insides hurt.

1190
01:32:00,518 --> 01:32:02,261
I don't really care. Back away.

1191
01:32:02,437 --> 01:32:05,603
The boss said he'd make the voices
go away.

1192
01:32:05,774 --> 01:32:09,308
He said he'd go inside
and replace them with bright lights...

1193
01:32:09,486 --> 01:32:10,600
...like Christmas.

1194
01:32:10,778 --> 01:32:13,315
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.

1195
01:32:13,489 --> 01:32:16,324
Medic to the holding tank.
Come on. Get the door open.

1196
01:32:16,534 --> 01:32:17,696
You guys, back off!

1197
01:32:17,869 --> 01:32:20,027
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.

1198
01:32:20,204 --> 01:32:24,201
They told me that only one of us
was gonna make it...

1199
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:27,708
...and that they were gonna
let our friends choose.

1200
01:32:30,423 --> 01:32:32,545
Okay, Rachel.

1201
01:32:33,134 --> 01:32:36,253
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right.
They're coming for you.

1202
01:32:36,429 --> 01:32:40,722
Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me
through what's going on with you.

1203
01:32:40,891 --> 01:32:42,800
Can you find something,
anything, sharp?

1204
01:32:42,977 --> 01:32:44,387
I'm trying.

1205
01:32:44,562 --> 01:32:46,720
- What's...?
- Shit.

1206
01:32:46,897 --> 01:32:48,391
Harvey?

1207
01:32:52,153 --> 01:32:53,812
Harvey, what's happening?

1208
01:33:03,163 --> 01:33:06,994
All available units,
converge at 25052nd Street.

1209
01:33:07,334 --> 01:33:11,414
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?

1210
01:33:13,715 --> 01:33:15,043
Guns are too quick.

1211
01:33:15,217 --> 01:33:18,585
You can't savor all the...

1212
01:33:18,762 --> 01:33:22,095
...little emotions.

1213
01:33:24,017 --> 01:33:28,892
You see, in their last moments...

1214
01:33:29,064 --> 01:33:31,352
...people show you who they really are.

1215
01:33:32,442 --> 01:33:38,112
So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.

1216
01:33:41,868 --> 01:33:45,283
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1217
01:33:51,795 --> 01:33:53,454
What's that?
Jeez.

1218
01:33:53,671 --> 01:33:55,710
He's got some kind of a...

1219
01:33:55,882 --> 01:33:59,085
...contusion.
- I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1220
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:04,218
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it
even more.

1221
01:34:09,437 --> 01:34:10,717
Whoa, whoa!

1222
01:34:11,773 --> 01:34:12,804
Just put it down.

1223
01:34:12,982 --> 01:34:15,769
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!

1224
01:34:15,943 --> 01:34:19,892
- It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!
- Let him go now! Drop it!

1225
01:34:20,198 --> 01:34:23,198
- What? Sorry?
- What do you want?

1226
01:34:24,243 --> 01:34:26,152
I just want my phone call.

1227
01:34:29,165 --> 01:34:31,834
What...? What...? What's happening?

1228
01:34:32,001 --> 01:34:34,836
Just talk to me, just for one second.

1229
01:34:37,173 --> 01:34:39,842
- All right?
- Right.

1230
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,170
Ow.

1231
01:34:44,096 --> 01:34:45,673
- Ow.
- Shh, shh, shh.

1232
01:34:51,645 --> 01:34:53,684
Is that a phone?

1233
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:04,693
Mount the curb!

1234
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:16,705
Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?

1235
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:18,669
Don 't think like that. They're coming.

1236
01:35:18,839 --> 01:35:21,127
I know they are,
but I don't want them to.

1237
01:35:25,554 --> 01:35:29,634
I don't wanna live without you,
and I do have an answer for you.

1238
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:31,801
My answer is yes.

1239
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:37,313
No! No! No!

1240
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:40,103
Not me! Why are you coming for me?

1241
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:41,307
No!

1242
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:44,564
Rachel! Rachel!

1243
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:47,106
- Harvey.
- No! No! Rachel!

1244
01:35:47,283 --> 01:35:48,314
Okay.

1245
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:49,572
Rachel!

1246
01:35:49,994 --> 01:35:51,536
No! No!

1247
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:55,832
Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen.

1248
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,328
Somewh...

1249
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:04,414
No, commissioner!

1250
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:07,261
Rachel! No!

1251
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:22,723
Hello there.

1252
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:32,115
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.

1253
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:34,744
With Lau?

1254
01:36:37,541 --> 01:36:40,114
The Joker planned to be caught.

1255
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:42,619
He wanted me to lock him up
in the MCU.

1256
01:37:02,274 --> 01:37:04,313
Dear Bruce:

1257
01:37:06,069 --> 01:37:08,606
I need to be honest and clear.

1258
01:37:10,657 --> 01:37:13,194
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.

1259
01:37:13,368 --> 01:37:17,282
I love him, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.

1260
01:37:17,831 --> 01:37:22,243
When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman, we could be together...

1261
01:37:22,419 --> 01:37:24,625
... I meant it.

1262
01:37:24,879 --> 01:37:29,624
But now I'm sure the day won 't come
when you no longer need Batman.

1263
01:37:30,677 --> 01:37:32,586
I hope it does.

1264
01:37:32,762 --> 01:37:35,513
And if it does, I will be there...

1265
01:37:36,057 --> 01:37:37,467
... but as your friend.

1266
01:37:38,184 --> 01:37:40,425
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1267
01:37:40,603 --> 01:37:42,975
I'm sorry to let you down.

1268
01:37:43,147 --> 01:37:48,141
If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.

1269
01:37:48,736 --> 01:37:53,148
Love, now and always, Rachel.

1270
01:38:01,123 --> 01:38:03,448
Prepared a little breakfast.

1271
01:38:07,588 --> 01:38:09,497
- Very well, then.
- Alfred.

1272
01:38:09,674 --> 01:38:10,836
Yes, Master Wayne?

1273
01:38:12,218 --> 01:38:14,459
Did I bring this on her?

1274
01:38:15,513 --> 01:38:17,719
I was meant to inspire good...

1275
01:38:17,890 --> 01:38:20,262
...not madness, not death.

1276
01:38:20,434 --> 01:38:25,060
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1277
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:27,306
Didn't you think
there might be casualties?

1278
01:38:27,483 --> 01:38:29,890
Things always get worse
before they get better.

1279
01:38:30,235 --> 01:38:31,693
But Rachel, Alfred.

1280
01:38:31,862 --> 01:38:35,645
Rachel believed in what you stood for...

1281
01:38:35,824 --> 01:38:37,733
...what we stand for.

1282
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:39,368
Gotham needs you.

1283
01:38:39,912 --> 01:38:42,865
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1284
01:38:43,373 --> 01:38:47,501
...and I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.

1285
01:38:47,669 --> 01:38:49,994
Which is why, for now...

1286
01:38:50,797 --> 01:38:52,706
...they're gonna have to
make do with you.

1287
01:38:54,926 --> 01:38:56,752
She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.

1288
01:38:58,764 --> 01:39:00,803
Dent doesn't know.

1289
01:39:00,974 --> 01:39:02,254
He can never know.

1290
01:39:04,686 --> 01:39:06,310
What's that?

1291
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:09,432
- It can wait.
- That bandit...

1292
01:39:09,899 --> 01:39:12,021
...in the forest in Burma.

1293
01:39:12,193 --> 01:39:14,232
- Did you catch him?
- Yes.

1294
01:39:14,404 --> 01:39:15,732
How?

1295
01:39:17,157 --> 01:39:18,781
We burned the forest down.

1296
01:39:58,030 --> 01:40:00,651
He's credible, an M & A lawyer
from a leading consultancy.

1297
01:40:00,825 --> 01:40:04,193
He says he's waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing.

1298
01:40:04,370 --> 01:40:06,446
Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.

1299
01:40:06,622 --> 01:40:09,575
We'll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.

1300
01:40:26,016 --> 01:40:27,640
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1301
01:40:30,354 --> 01:40:35,181
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.

1302
01:40:36,234 --> 01:40:38,191
That you're refusing to...

1303
01:40:38,362 --> 01:40:40,105
...accept skin grafts.

1304
01:40:40,447 --> 01:40:42,688
Remember that name...

1305
01:40:43,283 --> 01:40:45,608
...you all had for me...

1306
01:40:46,078 --> 01:40:48,913
...when I was at Internal Affairs?

1307
01:40:51,374 --> 01:40:52,654
What was it, Gordon?

1308
01:40:53,335 --> 01:40:54,710
Harvey, I...

1309
01:40:54,878 --> 01:40:56,372
Say it.

1310
01:40:57,797 --> 01:40:59,706
Say it!

1311
01:41:07,390 --> 01:41:10,474
Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.

1312
01:41:12,061 --> 01:41:16,354
Why should I hide who I am?

1313
01:41:17,567 --> 01:41:18,895
I know you tried to warn me.

1314
01:41:19,777 --> 01:41:20,975
I'm sorry.

1315
01:41:21,612 --> 01:41:24,233
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1316
01:41:26,534 --> 01:41:28,906
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1317
01:41:29,746 --> 01:41:32,746
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1318
01:41:33,124 --> 01:41:35,246
Why would you listen to me now?

1319
01:41:36,377 --> 01:41:38,036
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1320
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:42,381
No.

1321
01:41:42,842 --> 01:41:44,964
No, you're not.

1322
01:41:46,012 --> 01:41:47,256
Not yet.

1323
01:41:52,518 --> 01:41:55,222
This craziness, it's too much.

1324
01:41:55,437 --> 01:41:58,687
Should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1325
01:41:58,858 --> 01:42:00,601
MARONl:
You want him?

1326
01:42:03,070 --> 01:42:05,395
I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.

1327
01:42:13,455 --> 01:42:15,743
Not so crazy as you look.

1328
01:42:15,916 --> 01:42:19,664
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1329
01:42:22,881 --> 01:42:24,125
Where is the Italian?

1330
01:42:24,299 --> 01:42:27,418
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1331
01:42:27,594 --> 01:42:31,045
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1332
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:32,802
Please.

1333
01:42:32,974 --> 01:42:36,307
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1334
01:42:36,978 --> 01:42:39,647
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1335
01:42:39,814 --> 01:42:41,473
I enjoy...

1336
01:42:41,650 --> 01:42:43,025
...dynamite...

1337
01:42:43,193 --> 01:42:44,735
...and gunpowder...

1338
01:42:45,195 --> 01:42:47,602
...and gasoline.

1339
01:42:49,074 --> 01:42:51,315
- What the...?
- Ah, ah, ah.

1340
01:42:53,161 --> 01:42:55,996
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1341
01:42:56,498 --> 01:42:57,778
They're cheap.

1342
01:42:57,957 --> 01:43:00,626
How much are they
paying you to say who Batman is?

1343
01:43:00,793 --> 01:43:04,742
This is our chance. I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.

1344
01:43:04,923 --> 01:43:06,333
Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.

1345
01:43:06,507 --> 01:43:07,835
Let's take the next caller.

1346
01:43:08,009 --> 01:43:10,167
Harvey Dent didn 't wanna
give in to this maniac.

1347
01:43:10,345 --> 01:43:11,625
You think you know better?

1348
01:43:11,804 --> 01:43:15,172
I think that if we could talk to Dent
today, he may feel differently.

1349
01:43:15,349 --> 01:43:19,429
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because God knows, we need him now.

1350
01:43:19,604 --> 01:43:21,810
You said you were a man of your word.

1351
01:43:22,106 --> 01:43:24,145
Oh, I am.

1352
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:28,529
I'm only burning my half.

1353
01:43:29,864 --> 01:43:31,986
All you care about is money.

1354
01:43:32,158 --> 01:43:35,609
This town deserves
a better class of criminal...

1355
01:43:35,786 --> 01:43:38,027
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1356
01:43:38,831 --> 01:43:41,321
Tell your men they work for me now.

1357
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:43,872
This is my city.

1358
01:43:44,545 --> 01:43:47,082
They won't work for a freak.

1359
01:43:47,256 --> 01:43:48,963
"Freak."

1360
01:43:49,133 --> 01:43:51,588
Why don't we
cut you up into little pieces...

1361
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,218
...and feed you to your pooches? Hm?

1362
01:43:53,387 --> 01:43:56,257
And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.

1363
01:43:58,267 --> 01:44:00,592
It's not about money...

1364
01:44:00,769 --> 01:44:03,972
...it's about sending a message.

1365
01:44:04,773 --> 01:44:07,228
Everything burns.

1366
01:44:09,736 --> 01:44:11,894
- Who is this?
I had a vision...

1367
01:44:12,072 --> 01:44:14,823
... of a world without Batman.

1368
01:44:14,992 --> 01:44:17,233
The Mob ground out a little profit...

1369
01:44:17,411 --> 01:44:21,325
... and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.

1370
01:44:21,498 --> 01:44:24,783
And it was so boring.

1371
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,917
I've had a change of heart.

1372
01:44:27,087 --> 01:44:29,708
I don 't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...

1373
01:44:29,881 --> 01:44:34,589
... but why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.

1374
01:44:34,761 --> 01:44:39,588
If Coleman Reese
isn 't dead in 60 minutes...

1375
01:44:39,766 --> 01:44:41,842
... then I blow up a hospital.

1376
01:44:42,018 --> 01:44:43,595
Call in every officer.

1377
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:47,103
Tell them to head to their nearest
hospital and start evac and search.

1378
01:44:47,273 --> 01:44:49,395
Call the transit authority,
school board, prisons.

1379
01:44:49,567 --> 01:44:51,191
Get every bus down to a hospital.

1380
01:44:51,361 --> 01:44:55,939
The priority is Gotham General. Wheel
everybody out of that place right now.

1381
01:44:56,115 --> 01:44:57,774
You, you and you, you come with me.

1382
01:44:57,951 --> 01:44:59,824
- Where are we going, sir?
- To get Reese.

1383
01:45:00,161 --> 01:45:03,245
I need you plugged in, checking
Gordon's men and their families.

1384
01:45:03,414 --> 01:45:05,620
- Looking for?
- Hospital admissions.

1385
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:07,451
Will you be wanting the Batpod?

1386
01:45:07,627 --> 01:45:09,584
In the middle of the day?
Not very subtle.

1387
01:45:09,754 --> 01:45:11,034
The Lamborghini, then.

1388
01:45:11,964 --> 01:45:13,078
Much more subtle.

1389
01:45:26,937 --> 01:45:29,427
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1390
01:45:29,607 --> 01:45:33,106
Sir, could you help, please?

1391
01:45:33,277 --> 01:45:34,984
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1392
01:45:36,947 --> 01:45:38,820
Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...

1393
01:45:38,991 --> 01:45:41,149
...an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man?

1394
01:45:45,664 --> 01:45:47,989
Sir. Commissioner.

1395
01:45:50,085 --> 01:45:52,291
Get the cars around the back!

1396
01:45:54,673 --> 01:45:56,001
Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1397
01:46:01,972 --> 01:46:03,929
I see O'Brien and Richards.

1398
01:46:04,516 --> 01:46:08,015
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1399
01:46:09,312 --> 01:46:12,846
They're trying to kill me.
- Well, maybe Batman can save you.

1400
01:46:25,996 --> 01:46:28,617
Davis, they got space. Bring him out.

1401
01:46:30,291 --> 01:46:32,082
Davis.

1402
01:46:37,215 --> 01:46:39,540
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1403
01:46:39,717 --> 01:46:40,915
Nothing on them.

1404
01:46:41,094 --> 01:46:42,552
And a patrolman I don't know.

1405
01:46:43,763 --> 01:46:45,672
Okay, so, what now?

1406
01:46:46,557 --> 01:46:48,798
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1407
01:46:51,562 --> 01:46:53,221
Send the information to Gordon.

1408
01:47:01,113 --> 01:47:02,655
Get out of here.

1409
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:06,491
Davis.

1410
01:47:09,664 --> 01:47:12,071
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
move him now.

1411
01:47:23,761 --> 01:47:26,086
It's Berg, isn't it?
- Commissioner.

1412
01:47:27,222 --> 01:47:28,680
You okay, son?

1413
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:48,277
Hi.

1414
01:47:53,123 --> 01:47:54,617
You know...

1415
01:47:55,459 --> 01:47:58,543
...I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1416
01:47:58,712 --> 01:48:01,831
- When you and...
- Rachel!

1417
01:48:02,007 --> 01:48:04,295
- Rachel were being abducted...

1418
01:48:04,468 --> 01:48:07,468
...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1419
01:48:07,804 --> 01:48:09,713
I didn't rig those charges.

1420
01:48:09,931 --> 01:48:12,386
Your men, your plan.

1421
01:48:12,601 --> 01:48:15,056
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1422
01:48:15,478 --> 01:48:18,265
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1423
01:48:18,898 --> 01:48:21,353
I wouldn't know what to do with one
if I caught it.

1424
01:48:21,526 --> 01:48:24,645
You know? I just do things.

1425
01:48:25,029 --> 01:48:28,729
The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.

1426
01:48:28,908 --> 01:48:31,114
Gordon's got plans.

1427
01:48:31,286 --> 01:48:34,239
You know, they're schemers.

1428
01:48:34,414 --> 01:48:38,162
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1429
01:48:38,334 --> 01:48:39,828
I'm not a schemer.

1430
01:48:40,002 --> 01:48:41,626
I try to show the schemers...

1431
01:48:41,796 --> 01:48:47,086
...how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1432
01:48:48,052 --> 01:48:51,088
So when I say... Ah. Come here.

1433
01:48:51,597 --> 01:48:55,131
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...

1434
01:48:56,686 --> 01:48:58,892
...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

1435
01:49:01,399 --> 01:49:04,186
- I'm gonna need your weapon.
- What?

1436
01:49:07,947 --> 01:49:09,773
Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

1437
01:49:10,491 --> 01:49:12,033
Yeah, that'd be why.

1438
01:49:12,952 --> 01:49:16,155
It's the schemers
that put you where you are.

1439
01:49:16,330 --> 01:49:20,113
You were a schemer, you had plans...

1440
01:49:20,292 --> 01:49:22,450
...and look where that got you.

1441
01:49:33,222 --> 01:49:35,594
Police are taking every precaution...

1442
01:49:35,766 --> 01:49:37,888
... urging people not to
take matters into their hands.

1443
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:40,597
I just did what I do best.

1444
01:49:40,771 --> 01:49:44,389
I took your little plan
and I turned it on itself.

1445
01:49:44,566 --> 01:49:49,904
Look what I did to this city with a few
drums of gas and a couple of bullets.

1446
01:49:50,071 --> 01:49:53,356
Hm? You know what I noticed?

1447
01:49:53,533 --> 01:49:57,067
Nobody panics when
things go "according to plan."

1448
01:49:57,245 --> 01:49:58,904
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1449
01:49:59,539 --> 01:50:04,580
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,
a gangbanger will get shot...

1450
01:50:04,753 --> 01:50:08,204
...or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up...

1451
01:50:08,506 --> 01:50:09,585
...nobody panics.

1452
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:13,384
Because it's all part of the plan.

1453
01:50:13,553 --> 01:50:18,464
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...

1454
01:50:18,725 --> 01:50:21,132
...well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1455
01:50:24,564 --> 01:50:27,481
Introduce a little anarchy...

1456
01:50:28,651 --> 01:50:30,892
...upset the established order...

1457
01:50:31,070 --> 01:50:35,613
...and everything becomes chaos.

1458
01:50:37,451 --> 01:50:40,202
I'm an agent of chaos.

1459
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:42,905
Oh, and you know the thing
about chaos?

1460
01:50:44,959 --> 01:50:46,583
It's fair.

1461
01:50:55,803 --> 01:50:58,969
- You live.
- Mm-hm.

1462
01:50:59,473 --> 01:51:01,097
You die.

1463
01:51:01,308 --> 01:51:03,300
Mmm. Now we're talking.

1464
01:51:12,653 --> 01:51:14,147
Mr. Reese.

1465
01:51:32,339 --> 01:51:34,497
That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1466
01:51:34,674 --> 01:51:37,674
- That was a very brave thing you did.
- Trying to catch the light?

1467
01:51:38,011 --> 01:51:40,846
- You weren't protecting the van?
- Why? Who's in it?

1468
01:51:46,311 --> 01:51:48,387
Don't you think
I should go to the hospital?

1469
01:51:48,563 --> 01:51:51,053
Don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1470
01:52:57,214 --> 01:52:59,040
Southeast.

1471
01:52:59,216 --> 01:53:01,422
It's Gotham General.

1472
01:53:02,177 --> 01:53:03,836
- Did you clear the building?
Yeah.

1473
01:53:06,849 --> 01:53:08,556
You must know
how many were inside.

1474
01:53:08,725 --> 01:53:10,100
You have patient lists, roll call.

1475
01:53:10,269 --> 01:53:12,594
Right now we're showing
50 people missing. One bus.

1476
01:53:12,771 --> 01:53:15,937
The other buses were heading off to
hospitals. I guess we missed one.

1477
01:53:16,108 --> 01:53:18,230
What's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1478
01:53:18,402 --> 01:53:22,862
Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.
Anybody asks, we got him out.

1479
01:53:25,450 --> 01:53:27,857
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1480
01:53:29,037 --> 01:53:30,780
We're gonna need the National Guard.

1481
01:53:30,956 --> 01:53:32,580
- people are still missing...

1482
01:53:32,749 --> 01:53:33,947
... including GCN's own Mike Engel.

1483
01:53:34,125 --> 01:53:37,375
I'm now being told that we're cutting to
a video GCN has just received.

1484
01:53:37,545 --> 01:53:39,454
I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.

1485
01:53:39,965 --> 01:53:43,298
"What does it take
to make you people wanna join in?

1486
01:53:43,468 --> 01:53:46,041
You failed to kill the lawyer.
I've gotta get you off the bench...

1487
01:53:46,221 --> 01:53:47,964
...and into the game.
Bench. Game.

1488
01:53:50,141 --> 01:53:52,263
Come nightfall, this city is mine.
Mine.

1489
01:53:52,435 --> 01:53:55,186
- And anyone left here plays by my rules.
- Rules.

1490
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:58,813
Mr. Fox? Security is showing
a break-in at the R & D Department.

1491
01:53:58,983 --> 01:54:01,105
If you don 't wanna be in the game...

1492
01:54:01,277 --> 01:54:02,652
...get out now.
- Get out now.

1493
01:54:04,822 --> 01:54:07,775
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise.

1494
01:54:08,159 --> 01:54:09,866
Ha-ha, ha-ha. "

1495
01:54:43,527 --> 01:54:44,807
Gotham P.D.
has shut down...

1496
01:54:44,987 --> 01:54:47,442
Sweet Jesus.
...the area 's bridges and tunnels.

1497
01:54:47,614 --> 01:54:51,029
Shouldn't you be out there,
you know, doing something?

1498
01:54:51,201 --> 01:54:53,158
It's my day off.

1499
01:54:53,787 --> 01:54:55,364
I gotta take a leak.

1500
01:54:55,539 --> 01:54:57,864
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1501
01:55:03,463 --> 01:55:05,420
Now what?
Need someone to shake it for you?

1502
01:55:05,591 --> 01:55:07,168
Hello.

1503
01:55:07,884 --> 01:55:09,378
Dent.

1504
01:55:09,553 --> 01:55:11,759
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1505
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:13,589
Half.

1506
01:55:19,646 --> 01:55:21,223
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1507
01:55:21,398 --> 01:55:23,390
- It must've been Maroni's men.
- Shut up!

1508
01:55:25,151 --> 01:55:27,273
Are you telling me
that you're gonna protect...

1509
01:55:27,445 --> 01:55:29,188
...the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1510
01:55:29,364 --> 01:55:30,822
I don't know, he never told me.

1511
01:55:30,991 --> 01:55:34,609
Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't
know what they were gonna do to you.

1512
01:55:36,162 --> 01:55:37,324
That's funny...

1513
01:55:39,082 --> 01:55:41,833
...because I don't know
what's gonna happen to you either.

1514
01:55:45,964 --> 01:55:47,873
Beautiful, isn't it?

1515
01:55:48,258 --> 01:55:49,917
Beautiful.

1516
01:55:50,468 --> 01:55:51,582
Unethical.

1517
01:55:52,762 --> 01:55:54,304
Dangerous.

1518
01:55:54,514 --> 01:55:58,013
You've turned every cell phone
in Gotham into a microphone.

1519
01:55:58,184 --> 01:56:00,591
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1520
01:56:00,770 --> 01:56:05,846
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.

1521
01:56:06,025 --> 01:56:10,603
With half the city feeding you sonar,
you can image all of Gotham.

1522
01:56:12,531 --> 01:56:13,906
This is wrong.

1523
01:56:14,075 --> 01:56:16,114
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1524
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:19,400
At what cost?

1525
01:56:19,580 --> 01:56:22,367
The database is null-key encrypted.

1526
01:56:22,541 --> 01:56:24,747
It can only be accessed by one person.

1527
01:56:26,086 --> 01:56:28,244
This is too much power for one person.

1528
01:56:28,422 --> 01:56:30,580
That's why I gave it to you.

1529
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:32,248
Only you can use it.

1530
01:56:32,426 --> 01:56:36,209
Spying on 30 million people
isn't part of my job description.

1531
01:56:38,432 --> 01:56:42,132
This is an audio sample. If he talks
within range of any phone in the city...

1532
01:56:42,311 --> 01:56:44,517
...you can triangulate his position.

1533
01:56:44,980 --> 01:56:47,470
I'll help you this one time.

1534
01:56:47,941 --> 01:56:49,732
But consider this my resignation.

1535
01:56:49,902 --> 01:56:54,480
As long as this machine is
at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1536
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:57,149
When you're finished...

1537
01:56:57,826 --> 01:56:58,940
...type in your name.

1538
01:57:07,544 --> 01:57:10,628
My officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges...

1539
01:57:10,797 --> 01:57:14,000
...but with the Joker's threat,
they're not an option.

1540
01:57:14,175 --> 01:57:17,010
- And land routes east?
- Backed up for hours.

1541
01:57:17,178 --> 01:57:20,796
Which leaves the ferries
with 30,000 ready to board.

1542
01:57:20,974 --> 01:57:24,010
I wanna use the ferries so I can
get those prisoners off the island.

1543
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:27,139
The men you put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1544
01:57:27,313 --> 01:57:29,435
You should be.
Whatever the Joker's planning...

1545
01:57:29,607 --> 01:57:34,103
...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are
involved. I wanna get them out of here.

1546
01:57:35,572 --> 01:57:36,770
So where is Harvey?

1547
01:57:37,365 --> 01:57:40,531
- We haven't found him.
- Oh, Jesus.

1548
01:57:44,372 --> 01:57:46,448
How long can you keep this quiet?

1549
01:58:00,554 --> 01:58:03,223
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

1550
01:58:04,058 --> 01:58:06,216
Going to join your wife?

1551
01:58:09,730 --> 01:58:12,220
- You love her?
- Yes.

1552
01:58:13,108 --> 01:58:16,061
You ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?

1553
01:58:16,237 --> 01:58:17,731
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1554
01:58:17,905 --> 01:58:21,155
He killed your woman. He made you...

1555
01:58:21,325 --> 01:58:22,356
...like this.

1556
01:58:22,743 --> 01:58:25,743
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1557
01:58:25,913 --> 01:58:28,534
I want whoever let him off the leash.

1558
01:58:29,249 --> 01:58:32,582
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1559
01:58:32,753 --> 01:58:35,374
Who picked up Rachel?
Must have been someone she trusted.

1560
01:58:36,590 --> 01:58:38,712
Look, if I tell you...

1561
01:58:38,884 --> 01:58:39,915
...will you let me go?

1562
01:58:40,677 --> 01:58:42,005
Can't hurt your chances.

1563
01:58:44,765 --> 01:58:46,424
It was Ramirez.

1564
01:58:51,855 --> 01:58:55,105
- But you said...
- I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1565
01:58:58,695 --> 01:59:00,817
You're a lucky man.

1566
01:59:04,284 --> 01:59:06,027
- But he's not.
- Who?

1567
01:59:08,955 --> 01:59:10,365
Your driver.

1568
01:59:23,595 --> 01:59:24,626
Stand back.

1569
01:59:24,804 --> 01:59:27,129
Hey, that ain't right.
We should be on that boat.

1570
01:59:27,307 --> 01:59:29,880
You wanna ride across
with them? Be my guest.

1571
01:59:53,124 --> 01:59:54,831
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1572
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,031
Right, get on the radio.

1573
01:59:56,210 --> 01:59:59,828
Tell them we'll come back and pick
them up once we dump the scumbags.

1574
02:00:00,005 --> 02:00:02,377
Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.

1575
02:00:04,426 --> 02:00:05,624
What the heck was that?

1576
02:00:07,554 --> 02:00:09,012
What the...?

1577
02:00:09,556 --> 02:00:12,841
Liberty,
come in, please. This is Spirit. Come in.

1578
02:00:14,478 --> 02:00:16,351
Liberty, we have the same thing.
We've lost both engines.

1579
02:00:16,522 --> 02:00:18,016
- Liberty, come in.
Fox.

1580
02:00:18,190 --> 02:00:20,680
There's something going on
on the ferries.

1581
02:00:21,443 --> 02:00:23,731
Get down to the engine room now.

1582
02:00:24,363 --> 02:00:26,569
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1583
02:00:35,165 --> 02:00:38,616
Captain, we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1584
02:00:51,723 --> 02:00:52,802
Oh, my God.

1585
02:00:52,974 --> 02:00:54,800
Looks like some kind of detonator.

1586
02:00:54,976 --> 02:00:57,846
Why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb?

1587
02:01:00,774 --> 02:01:02,149
Tonight, you're all gonna...

1588
02:01:02,317 --> 02:01:04,060
... be a part of a social experiment.

1589
02:01:07,906 --> 02:01:11,737
Through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate...

1590
02:01:11,910 --> 02:01:15,990
... I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky-high.

1591
02:01:16,164 --> 02:01:18,240
Liberty, come in, over.

1592
02:01:19,709 --> 02:01:20,740
It's dead.

1593
02:01:21,085 --> 02:01:25,581
If anyone attempts
to get off their boat, you all die.

1594
02:01:25,923 --> 02:01:27,203
I'm zeroing in.

1595
02:01:27,383 --> 02:01:31,926
Each of you has a remote
to blow up the other boat.

1596
02:01:32,096 --> 02:01:34,551
His voice is on the ferry...

1597
02:01:34,724 --> 02:01:36,763
...but it's not the source.

1598
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:40,134
West.

1599
02:01:47,403 --> 02:01:49,691
- Gordon.
I have the Joker's location.

1600
02:01:49,864 --> 02:01:50,943
Prewitt Building.

1601
02:01:51,115 --> 02:01:53,570
Assemble on the building opposite.

1602
02:01:54,952 --> 02:01:57,739
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1603
02:01:57,913 --> 02:02:03,073
lf, however, one of you presses
the button, I'll let that boat live.

1604
02:02:03,252 --> 02:02:05,374
So who 's it gonna be?

1605
02:02:05,546 --> 02:02:08,083
Harvey Dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...

1606
02:02:08,257 --> 02:02:11,590
... or the sweet and innocent civilians?

1607
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:14,297
You choose.

1608
02:02:14,471 --> 02:02:16,380
Oh, and you might wanna
decide quickly...

1609
02:02:16,557 --> 02:02:20,886
... because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.

1610
02:02:28,276 --> 02:02:29,307
Stay back.

1611
02:02:29,486 --> 02:02:33,269
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.

1612
02:02:33,657 --> 02:02:37,239
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1613
02:02:37,869 --> 02:02:41,652
- We are not going to talk about this.
- Why aren't we talking about it?

1614
02:02:41,831 --> 02:02:44,404
They're talking over the same thing
on the other boat.

1615
02:02:44,584 --> 02:02:46,872
- Let's put it to a vote.
Yes!

1616
02:02:52,175 --> 02:02:54,748
- Hello?
Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.

1617
02:02:54,928 --> 02:02:57,964
Jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away.

1618
02:02:58,139 --> 02:02:59,846
But the units outside...

1619
02:03:00,016 --> 02:03:01,593
Those cops can 't be trusted.

1620
02:03:01,768 --> 02:03:04,721
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1621
02:03:04,896 --> 02:03:07,849
I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.

1622
02:03:08,024 --> 02:03:11,855
- But where am I supposed to take them?
- 25052nd Street.

1623
02:03:12,028 --> 02:03:13,901
Leave as soon as
the patrol car pulls out.

1624
02:03:14,071 --> 02:03:15,446
Okay.

1625
02:03:15,823 --> 02:03:17,614
She believe you?

1626
02:03:17,825 --> 02:03:19,864
It's because she trusts you...

1627
02:03:20,203 --> 02:03:21,282
...just like Rachel did.

1628
02:03:21,454 --> 02:03:23,530
- I didn't know...
- Didn't know what they'd do?

1629
02:03:23,706 --> 02:03:26,457
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1630
02:03:26,709 --> 02:03:28,831
What exactly did you think
they were gonna do?

1631
02:03:29,003 --> 02:03:31,244
They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills...

1632
02:03:31,422 --> 02:03:34,458
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1633
02:03:35,009 --> 02:03:37,464
You live to fight another day, officer.

1634
02:03:41,265 --> 02:03:43,091
We found the missing hospital bus.

1635
02:03:43,267 --> 02:03:44,974
Then we have a hostage situation.

1636
02:03:47,062 --> 02:03:49,054
It's a shooting gallery.

1637
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,728
Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows?

1638
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:53,726
We have clear shots on five clowns.

1639
02:03:53,902 --> 02:03:56,653
Snipers take them out,
smash the windows, a team rappels in.

1640
02:03:57,072 --> 02:03:58,566
Team moves in by the stairwells.

1641
02:03:58,740 --> 02:04:00,862
Two, three casualties max.

1642
02:04:01,034 --> 02:04:02,907
- Let's do it.
It's not that simple.

1643
02:04:03,078 --> 02:04:05,403
- With the Joker, it never is.
- What's simple is...

1644
02:04:05,581 --> 02:04:08,747
...every second, those people on
the ferries get closer to blowing...

1645
02:04:08,917 --> 02:04:11,454
- That won't happen.
- Then he'll blow both of them up!

1646
02:04:11,628 --> 02:04:15,376
- We don't have time for paper ballots.
- I want everybody to put their votes...

1647
02:04:15,549 --> 02:04:17,541
...on this piece of paper.

1648
02:04:18,593 --> 02:04:21,428
If anyone's got pens, pass it along.

1649
02:04:21,763 --> 02:04:23,554
Thank you.
Anybody else?

1650
02:04:23,723 --> 02:04:25,549
Coming through. Anybody else?
Thank you.

1651
02:04:25,725 --> 02:04:28,595
We need to get these votes in quickly.

1652
02:04:28,770 --> 02:04:30,312
Come on.

1653
02:04:32,315 --> 02:04:34,437
What are you waiting for?
Push the button!

1654
02:04:34,609 --> 02:04:36,566
We're running out of time!

1655
02:04:37,862 --> 02:04:39,688
I need five minutes alone.

1656
02:04:39,864 --> 02:04:41,690
No! There's no time!

1657
02:04:41,866 --> 02:04:43,276
We have clear shots!

1658
02:04:43,451 --> 02:04:46,368
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!

1659
02:04:46,538 --> 02:04:48,495
I have to save Dent.

1660
02:04:48,665 --> 02:04:49,779
Get ready.

1661
02:04:52,627 --> 02:04:55,296
Two minutes, then we breach.

1662
02:05:00,885 --> 02:05:02,379
Fox, I need picture.

1663
02:05:05,431 --> 02:05:07,886
- Hello?
Jim, we're in trouble.

1664
02:05:09,143 --> 02:05:11,431
Okay, you got POV on alpha...

1665
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:14,437
... omni on beta.

1666
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:19,268
Looks like clowns and hostages
on two floors.

1667
02:05:19,445 --> 02:05:21,852
There's a SWA T team on the stairwell.

1668
02:05:25,159 --> 02:05:27,780
Another SWA T team on the roof.

1669
02:05:29,330 --> 02:05:30,528
Line's clear.

1670
02:05:32,291 --> 02:05:34,995
- Barbara, calm down.
- He has the kids!

1671
02:05:35,169 --> 02:05:38,419
Hello, Jim.
- Harvey?

1672
02:05:39,214 --> 02:05:42,417
- Where's my family?
- Where my family died.

1673
02:05:45,512 --> 02:05:47,171
Blue team, acquire the target.

1674
02:05:48,849 --> 02:05:51,422
Entry team, set your charge.

1675
02:06:07,367 --> 02:06:09,193
Fox, the SWA Ts are
targeting the wrong people.

1676
02:06:09,369 --> 02:06:10,863
The clowns are the hostages.

1677
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:13,371
Red team, go! Red team, go!

1678
02:06:17,127 --> 02:06:18,537
Entry team, blow and go!

1679
02:06:22,632 --> 02:06:24,042
Don't move.

1680
02:06:25,218 --> 02:06:26,593
Take the shot.

1681
02:06:32,225 --> 02:06:33,884
Those SWA Ts are coming in hot.

1682
02:06:34,060 --> 02:06:35,886
Clowns, put down your guns.

1683
02:06:36,396 --> 02:06:39,017
Drop your weapons!
On the ground, now!

1684
02:06:39,232 --> 02:06:42,398
Doctors, get down!
Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap...

1685
02:07:07,009 --> 02:07:08,171
Freeze!

1686
02:07:08,344 --> 02:07:10,716
Stand down or you will be...

1687
02:07:14,266 --> 02:07:15,724
Look up.

1688
02:07:16,310 --> 02:07:18,883
See those bad guys on the floor above?

1689
02:07:19,063 --> 02:07:22,063
They're waiting to ambush
the SWA T team coming up the elevator.

1690
02:07:22,524 --> 02:07:23,555
Sixty seconds.

1691
02:07:31,867 --> 02:07:36,445
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1692
02:07:44,588 --> 02:07:47,125
So go ahead. Do it.

1693
02:07:47,299 --> 02:07:49,291
We're still here.

1694
02:07:50,469 --> 02:07:53,422
And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

1695
02:07:54,890 --> 02:07:56,633
Go, go, go!

1696
02:07:56,808 --> 02:07:58,599
Blue team, cover!

1697
02:08:01,563 --> 02:08:02,594
Uh-oh.

1698
02:08:04,107 --> 02:08:05,766
Trouble on the floor above.

1699
02:08:15,118 --> 02:08:16,493
Get down on the ground now!

1700
02:08:24,919 --> 02:08:27,326
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.

1701
02:08:27,505 --> 02:08:29,497
We will shoot you. Drop the officer.

1702
02:08:29,674 --> 02:08:31,216
Release the officer right now.

1703
02:08:31,384 --> 02:08:33,341
Let him go now!
On your knees!

1704
02:08:33,928 --> 02:08:36,004
We got him. He's out of the game.

1705
02:08:36,180 --> 02:08:38,670
Keep your hands in the air!
Step away from the edge!

1706
02:08:46,732 --> 02:08:48,356
Halt!

1707
02:09:01,664 --> 02:09:03,039
Stay down!
Don't move!

1708
02:09:03,207 --> 02:09:07,500
Be advised. Clowns
are hostages, doctors are targets.

1709
02:09:13,801 --> 02:09:15,959
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1710
02:09:16,136 --> 02:09:19,302
- Where's the detonator?
- Go get him.

1711
02:09:32,694 --> 02:09:35,778
Put down your weapon!
Don't move!

1712
02:10:07,187 --> 02:10:09,060
You don't wanna die...

1713
02:10:09,230 --> 02:10:12,266
...but you don't know how to take a life.

1714
02:10:12,442 --> 02:10:14,101
Give it to me.

1715
02:10:14,402 --> 02:10:18,731
These men will kill you
and take it anyway.

1716
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:24,650
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1717
02:10:24,829 --> 02:10:27,782
Fine. I'll do it.

1718
02:10:29,459 --> 02:10:32,163
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.

1719
02:10:32,336 --> 02:10:34,624
They chose to murder and steal.

1720
02:10:34,797 --> 02:10:38,000
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1721
02:10:47,476 --> 02:10:49,931
All the old familiar places.

1722
02:10:56,235 --> 02:10:57,314
Stand by.

1723
02:11:07,663 --> 02:11:11,245
Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.

1724
02:11:11,458 --> 02:11:13,534
Give it to me.

1725
02:11:14,962 --> 02:11:18,710
You can tell them I took it by force.

1726
02:11:19,216 --> 02:11:24,127
Give it to me, and I'll do what
you should've did 10 minutes ago.

1727
02:11:46,201 --> 02:11:49,534
We really should stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1728
02:11:49,704 --> 02:11:51,530
There won't be any fireworks.

1729
02:11:51,956 --> 02:11:55,159
And here we go.

1730
02:12:34,498 --> 02:12:36,407
What were you trying to prove?

1731
02:12:36,584 --> 02:12:39,537
That deep down,
everyone's as ugly as you?

1732
02:12:40,671 --> 02:12:41,702
You're alone.

1733
02:12:48,304 --> 02:12:53,808
Can't rely on anyone these days. You
gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?

1734
02:12:54,018 --> 02:12:56,853
That's okay. I came prepared.

1735
02:12:57,062 --> 02:13:01,522
It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of
which, you know how I got these scars?

1736
02:13:01,692 --> 02:13:04,527
No, but I know how you got these.

1737
02:13:22,337 --> 02:13:25,088
Oh, you.

1738
02:13:25,257 --> 02:13:28,293
You just couldn't let me go, could you?

1739
02:13:29,427 --> 02:13:33,341
This is what happens
when an unstoppable force...

1740
02:13:33,515 --> 02:13:37,975
...meets an immovable object.

1741
02:13:38,561 --> 02:13:43,981
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

1742
02:13:44,150 --> 02:13:46,854
Huh? You won't kill me...

1743
02:13:47,028 --> 02:13:53,279
...out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness.

1744
02:13:53,451 --> 02:13:56,654
And I won't kill you...

1745
02:13:56,829 --> 02:14:00,612
...because you're just too much fun.

1746
02:14:01,667 --> 02:14:05,830
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

1747
02:14:06,005 --> 02:14:07,997
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1748
02:14:08,174 --> 02:14:10,000
Maybe we could share one.

1749
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:11,634
You know,
they'll be doubling up...

1750
02:14:11,802 --> 02:14:14,339
...the rate this city's inhabitants
are losing their minds.

1751
02:14:14,513 --> 02:14:17,632
This city just showed you...

1752
02:14:17,808 --> 02:14:21,852
...that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.

1753
02:14:22,021 --> 02:14:25,187
Until their spirit breaks completely.

1754
02:14:26,067 --> 02:14:30,894
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent...

1755
02:14:31,071 --> 02:14:33,858
...and all the heroic things he's done.

1756
02:14:35,534 --> 02:14:40,575
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul...

1757
02:14:40,748 --> 02:14:43,665
...in a fistfight with you?

1758
02:14:44,209 --> 02:14:45,751
No.

1759
02:14:45,919 --> 02:14:49,334
You need an ace in the hole.

1760
02:14:49,506 --> 02:14:51,130
Mine's Harvey.

1761
02:14:51,508 --> 02:14:53,215
What did you do?

1762
02:14:53,385 --> 02:14:56,385
I took Gotham's white knight...

1763
02:14:56,555 --> 02:15:00,173
...and I brought him down to our level.

1764
02:15:00,601 --> 02:15:03,554
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...

1765
02:15:03,729 --> 02:15:06,765
...is like gravity.

1766
02:15:06,940 --> 02:15:09,265
All it takes is a little push.

1767
02:15:26,209 --> 02:15:27,952
Dent!

1768
02:15:48,940 --> 02:15:53,269
This is where they brought her,
Gordon, after your men handed her over.

1769
02:15:54,028 --> 02:15:55,605
This is where she died.

1770
02:15:55,780 --> 02:15:58,105
I know, I was here...

1771
02:15:59,158 --> 02:16:01,909
...trying to save her.
- But you didn't.

1772
02:16:02,203 --> 02:16:03,946
- I couldn't.
- Yes, you could've.

1773
02:16:04,121 --> 02:16:05,615
If you'd listened to me.

1774
02:16:05,790 --> 02:16:08,411
If you stood up against corruption...

1775
02:16:08,584 --> 02:16:10,790
...instead of doing your deal
with the devil.

1776
02:16:10,961 --> 02:16:12,585
I was trying to fight the Mob!

1777
02:16:13,089 --> 02:16:17,916
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what I'd lost.

1778
02:16:19,220 --> 02:16:22,339
Have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most...

1779
02:16:22,515 --> 02:16:26,382
...tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?

1780
02:16:28,062 --> 02:16:31,929
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1781
02:16:32,691 --> 02:16:36,558
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1782
02:16:38,322 --> 02:16:41,904
- You're not going to hurt my family.
- No.

1783
02:16:42,075 --> 02:16:44,779
Just the person you love most.

1784
02:16:52,794 --> 02:16:55,830
So is it your wife?

1785
02:16:56,923 --> 02:16:58,582
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1786
02:16:58,967 --> 02:17:00,626
Harvey, put down the gun.

1787
02:17:00,802 --> 02:17:04,336
Please. Please, Harvey. Please.

1788
02:17:05,724 --> 02:17:07,004
Oh, goddamn it.

1789
02:17:07,183 --> 02:17:09,341
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family?

1790
02:17:09,853 --> 02:17:11,512
No!
- We have a winner.

1791
02:17:11,688 --> 02:17:13,182
No, Jim, stop him!

1792
02:17:13,690 --> 02:17:15,516
Harvey.
Don't let him...

1793
02:17:15,692 --> 02:17:16,806
Harvey!

1794
02:17:18,194 --> 02:17:20,067
I'm sorry!

1795
02:17:21,865 --> 02:17:22,944
For everything.

1796
02:17:25,535 --> 02:17:27,741
Please don't hurt my son.

1797
02:17:37,880 --> 02:17:39,457
You brought your cops?

1798
02:17:39,632 --> 02:17:42,502
All they know is there's a situation.

1799
02:17:42,677 --> 02:17:45,677
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1800
02:17:45,847 --> 02:17:48,516
You think I wanna escape from this?

1801
02:17:48,683 --> 02:17:51,434
There is no escape from this.

1802
02:17:51,602 --> 02:17:53,724
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1803
02:17:56,023 --> 02:17:59,226
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1804
02:17:59,985 --> 02:18:04,196
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.

1805
02:18:06,992 --> 02:18:08,071
But you were wrong.

1806
02:18:08,786 --> 02:18:12,569
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...

1807
02:18:13,332 --> 02:18:15,241
...is chance.

1808
02:18:15,417 --> 02:18:17,124
Unbiased.

1809
02:18:17,336 --> 02:18:18,580
Unprejudiced.

1810
02:18:19,963 --> 02:18:21,077
Fair.

1811
02:18:21,256 --> 02:18:23,497
His son's got the same chance she had.

1812
02:18:24,259 --> 02:18:25,539
Fifty-fifty.

1813
02:18:25,719 --> 02:18:29,170
What happened to Rachel wasn't
chance. We decided to act.

1814
02:18:29,515 --> 02:18:30,843
We three.

1815
02:18:31,016 --> 02:18:34,431
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?

1816
02:18:36,939 --> 02:18:39,560
- It wasn't.
- The Joker chose me.

1817
02:18:39,733 --> 02:18:42,021
Because you were the best of us.

1818
02:18:42,194 --> 02:18:47,188
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...

1819
02:18:47,365 --> 02:18:49,108
...could fall.

1820
02:18:49,451 --> 02:18:50,731
And he was right.

1821
02:18:50,911 --> 02:18:53,152
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1822
02:18:53,330 --> 02:18:56,366
So point it at the people responsible.

1823
02:18:57,334 --> 02:18:59,160
Fair enough.

1824
02:19:02,505 --> 02:19:04,378
You first.

1825
02:19:16,895 --> 02:19:18,554
My turn.

1826
02:19:25,486 --> 02:19:27,478
Harvey, you're right.

1827
02:19:28,531 --> 02:19:31,152
Rachel's death was my fault.

1828
02:19:34,245 --> 02:19:36,700
Please don't punish the boy.

1829
02:19:37,790 --> 02:19:40,993
- Please, punish me.
- I'm about to.

1830
02:19:42,962 --> 02:19:44,919
Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1831
02:19:45,381 --> 02:19:47,005
Lie...

1832
02:19:47,508 --> 02:19:48,622
...like I lied.

1833
02:19:52,388 --> 02:19:53,965
It's going to be all right, son.

1834
02:20:32,386 --> 02:20:35,221
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

1835
02:20:51,738 --> 02:20:53,896
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

1836
02:20:54,532 --> 02:20:56,323
Yes, I do.

1837
02:21:00,580 --> 02:21:01,908
The Joker won.

1838
02:21:04,334 --> 02:21:07,204
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1839
02:21:07,754 --> 02:21:09,497
...undone.

1840
02:21:10,006 --> 02:21:14,917
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1841
02:21:15,094 --> 02:21:16,256
We bet it all on him.

1842
02:21:17,597 --> 02:21:20,467
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1843
02:21:21,058 --> 02:21:22,468
People will lose hope.

1844
02:21:22,643 --> 02:21:24,386
They won't.

1845
02:21:26,898 --> 02:21:28,771
They must never know what he did.

1846
02:21:28,941 --> 02:21:30,767
Five dead.

1847
02:21:31,068 --> 02:21:32,348
Two of them cops.

1848
02:21:32,528 --> 02:21:34,983
- You can't sweep that...
- No.

1849
02:21:39,785 --> 02:21:42,620
But the Joker cannot win.

1850
02:21:47,877 --> 02:21:51,080
Gotham needs its true hero.

1851
02:21:57,469 --> 02:22:00,505
- No.
- You either die a hero...

1852
02:22:00,681 --> 02:22:05,141
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

1853
02:22:05,310 --> 02:22:07,136
I can do those things...

1854
02:22:07,563 --> 02:22:10,599
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

1855
02:22:13,610 --> 02:22:16,480
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1856
02:22:16,655 --> 02:22:18,564
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1857
02:22:18,740 --> 02:22:21,313
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1858
02:22:22,994 --> 02:22:24,108
Call it in.

1859
02:22:27,415 --> 02:22:29,158
A hero.

1860
02:22:29,334 --> 02:22:32,584
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1861
02:22:33,171 --> 02:22:35,708
Nothing less than a knight...

1862
02:22:36,258 --> 02:22:37,965
...shining.

1863
02:22:38,593 --> 02:22:40,217
They'll hunt you.

1864
02:22:40,387 --> 02:22:42,178
You'll hunt me.

1865
02:22:42,681 --> 02:22:44,638
You'll condemn me.

1866
02:22:45,350 --> 02:22:47,638
Set the dogs on me.

1867
02:22:51,397 --> 02:22:53,685
Because that's what needs to happen.

1868
02:22:54,859 --> 02:22:56,768
Because sometimes...

1869
02:22:56,945 --> 02:22:59,103
... the truth isn 't good enough.

1870
02:22:59,989 --> 02:23:02,277
Sometimes people deserve more.

1871
02:23:05,745 --> 02:23:09,659
Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.

1872
02:23:28,059 --> 02:23:29,718
Batman.

1873
02:23:31,645 --> 02:23:33,388
Batman!

1874
02:23:34,190 --> 02:23:36,147
Why's he running, Dad?

1875
02:23:37,193 --> 02:23:38,521
Because we have to chase him.

1876
02:23:38,694 --> 02:23:41,564
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

1877
02:23:47,661 --> 02:23:49,238
He didn't do anything wrong.

1878
02:23:51,999 --> 02:23:57,585
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1879
02:23:59,006 --> 02:24:00,037
So we'll hunt him...

1880
02:24:03,176 --> 02:24:05,252
... because he can take it.

1881
02:24:07,764 --> 02:24:10,254
Because he's not our hero.

1882
02:24:17,816 --> 02:24:19,014
He's a silent guardian...

1883
02:24:20,193 --> 02:24:22,066
...a watchful protector.

1884
02:24:24,573 --> 02:24:25,853
A dark knight.
